He also talked about having Imposter Syndrome during the multi-man match also involving Sting on the March 22 episode of AEW Dynamite.</p><p>“In that match, I called a spot where I was mocking him…I mocked the Stinger Splash and stuff like that,” Butcher said. “And I was on the other side of the ring, looking at him… You see the arena, and it’s filled with people, and they’re reacting, and you’re like, ‘What am I doing? What am I doing right now? Where am I? Am I in the world? I’m about to hit Sting with the Stinger Splash.’ I never put myself ever there, ever. And still, sometimes I have that imposter syndrome where I was just like. ‘This is so weird. I feel like I’m floating above myself,’ looking at the situation and thinking I’m watching Nitro.” (H/T <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WrestlingInc</a>)</p><p>The Butcher and Sting crossed paths on multiple occasions during the Icon and Darby Allin’s feud with The Butcher and The Blade.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2023/06/sting.jpg><h2 id=h-the-butcher-gets-sandwich-named-after-him>The Butcher gets sandwich named after him</h2><p>The Butcher and The Blade are considered two of the most destructive men in all of All Elite Wrestling. The pair have had solid feuds against the likes of the Hardys and Darby Allin and Sting.</p><p>Moreover, the duo have also had multiple tag team title shots but have yet to capture the tag gold in AEW. With that said, The Butcher recently received another honor as he got a sandwich <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">named after him</a> at Benny’s Brown Bag in Peekskill, New York.</p><p>“What’s up, you crumbs? It’s the Butcher here. And guess what, I love sandwiches. And guess who came out with their own sandwich based on the Butcher’s likings? It’s Benny’s Brown Bag. We got Turkey, that’s the king of meats. Dill pickle relish, pickled red onions. Honey mustard. The Mazaratti of all cheeses, Dill havarati cheese, on ciabatta bread. Go eat that sandwich at Benny’s Brown Bag right now… See what I am saying? People can’t stop eating it,” The Butcher said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqZ3FoZWLBqbGMm6ytm5iav26%2BxJyYpaSjYrSmwNOipaBlmaK9sL%2FTnqlmq6mjsbO7zJ5ksKqVqMGttc2gZJqfkZ67tMCMrKuippc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./net-worth-of-greg-norman.html><span>←</span><span>Net Worth Of Greg Norman</span></a>
