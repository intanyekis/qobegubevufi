Some actively go and seek out such relationships, whereas others are far more relaxed about the whole thing. But everyone’s looking for that connection with someone. This goes for everyone from all walks of life. You’d think it would be easier for celebs to find that person. In actual fact, it’s probably harder. That’s why a lot of celebs tend to get with and date other celebs. They’re around like-minded individuals, so it makes sense to date them. But the celebrity world can be seriously fake. Many of the actors and actresses put on a persona that they feel is expected of them. It’s therefore tough to find someone that’s genuine. That goes for men and women. But for women it must be harder.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let’s face it, female celebs are&nbsp;objectified an awful lot. People see a lot of them as beautiful celebs with&nbsp;great physiques, fellow celebrity figures included. So, forming meaningful relationships must be tough. Some have found it harder than others. They get in with the wrong person, and then, whether it’s due to that individual, or their own doing, things don’t work out. They end up going their separate ways, and these female celebs have ended up with their hearts broken after getting dumped. Getting dumped and breaking up is a horrible experience. For these 20 female celebs, it’s become an all too regular occurrence. These are 20 attractive female celebs who are always&nbsp;breaking up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-one-can-handle-katy-perry><strong>NO ONE CAN HANDLE KATY PERRY</strong></h2><p>Katy Perry seems like a very lovable person. Sure, she’s more than a tad wacky. That’s part of her personality, but she plays to it too, because that’s what she’s known for. But we see Katy, and she’s always smiling. She seems to be that kind of person. That doesn’t mean she can’t get serious. She’s a very intelligent woman, and aside from her music, she’s involved in various philanthropic causes and has ventured into other lines of work, such as being a spokeswoman for issues she feels strongly about. Needless to say, she’s also one seriously attractive celeb. Katy really does possess the entire package. You’d think she’d be a real catch. But she hasn’t had the best of luck when it comes to relationships. She’s had a string of failed ones over the years, including a two-year marriage to British comedian Russell Brand. Poor Katy; all she wants to do is find love, settle down, and become a mom. She’s said as much. Pretty much everyone loves Katy, and so it’s safe to say on behalf of everyone, that we hope it happens for Katy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-trend-is-changing-for-cameron-diaz><strong>THE TREND IS CHANGING FOR CAMERON DIAZ</strong></h2><p>Cameron Diaz is without doubt one of the biggest names in the industry. Even though she’s currently taking time off&nbsp;and is focusing on family life, when she resumes her career, she’ll jump straight into making hit films. Cameron started out way back in 1994. Over the years she’s risen to become one of the highest-paid actresses on-screen. She’s also regarded as being one of the most beautiful actresses around. One feels that she could have her pick of any guy she chooses. She has done just that but has made some rather bad choices, decisions she’s sure to regret. Her dating history reads like a "who’s who" of the celeb world. Among some of the most notable names, there’s Justin Timberlake and A-Rod. But now it seems as if her luck has changed. She’s currently hitched to musician Benji Madden and is reportedly pregnant with her first child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=britney-spears-flits-about-an-aweful-lot><strong>BRITNEY SPEARS FLITS ABOUT AN AWEFUL LOT</strong></h2><p>Britney Spears is still around, doing her thing, but has disappeared a little from the limelight. Once upon a time she was a major star&nbsp;and a massive A-lister. How times have changed. A lot of people would say that Britney is no longer relevant. Looking over the years, at her rise and fall from stardom, it seems inconceivable that Britney is only in her mid-30s! She’s packed a lot into this period, including a string of relationships, nearly all of which have ended on a sour note. Britney’s already been divorced twice. She was married to Kevin Federline and Jason Alexander. She’s also been engaged to Jason Trawick. Then there are a ton of other people who she’s had relationships with. Britney is currently with fitness model and aspiring actor, Sam Asghari. The two seem very loved up, so perhaps this one could be a keeper. Things could end happily ever after for the duo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-hilton-still-has-that-girl-about-town-tag><strong>PARIS HILTON STILL HAS THAT “GIRL ABOUT TOWN” TAG</strong></h2><p>Paris Hilton made her name as the “it” girl of the New York nighttime partying scene. She did of course already have some level of fame due to her family name. But she made a conscious decision to get herself out there&nbsp;and be someone who’s recognized for something other than being filthy rich. Many would say that Paris Hilton is famous for being famous. It’s not really a surprise that she attracts the wrong type of guys. You can imagine that initially it must be exciting to be with Paris, but living that kind of lifestyle isn’t for everybody. A lot of guys have&nbsp;run away from her&nbsp;over the years. Paris has done her fair share of breaking up, and she’s probably been dumped quite a lot of times too. At the moment though she looks to have found the one and is engaged to model and actor Chris Zylka.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lindsay-lohan-s-troubles-have-affected-her-dating-life><strong>LINDSAY LOHAN’S TROUBLES HAVE AFFECTED HER DATING LIFE</strong></h2><p>Lindsay Lohan’s fall from grace has been rather dramatic. Growing up, she was headed&nbsp;for big things. Instead she fell into a downwards spiral that she just couldn’t break from. Her issues have been well-documented. During this period, she spent a lot of time in the wilderness, heading further and further down that dark path. Now though, it seems like she’s snapped out of it. She is attempting to get back on the straight and narrow and revive her career. She’s probably attempting to sort out other aspects of her life too. Understandably during this wild period, Lindsay wouldn’t have been the model girlfriend. You can imagine her going off the rails quite a bit, and it would’ve been a tough time for anyone who she was in a relationship with. And there are a lot of people, both guys and girls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=madonna-s-been-with-a-lot-of-guys-over-her-40-years-in-the-industry><strong>MADONNA’S BEEN WITH A LOT OF GUYS OVER HER 40 YEARS IN THE INDUSTRY</strong></h2><p>Madonna is a superstar who just never stops. She started out what seems like many moons ago way back in 1977 and is still going strong to this day. During this time, she’s had plenty of companionship, is always flitting about from one guy to the next and rarely spends any time alone. Now she’s got six kids, she’s always busy, and is something of a super-mom. One feels that Madonna doesn’t really need a man in her life. That hasn’t stopped her from trying to find the perfect guy. But she’s always breaking up&nbsp;and is always getting dumped. She’s been married to Guy Ritchie, and she had a tumultuous marriage to Sean Penn. Her taste in men has been very colorful, almost as colorful as her career. In addition to her two failed marriages, Madonna’s known to have had relationships with a staggering 50 other people! Those are just the guys people know about. Recently she’s gone for dating guys who are a lot younger than her. It hasn’t surprised a lot of people when things eventually fizzle out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pamela-anderson-s-lifestyle-isn-t-for-everybody><strong>PAMELA ANDERSON’S LIFESTYLE ISN’T FOR EVERYBODY</strong></h2><p>We mentioned how the majority of female celebs get objectified, know it, and play to it too. They know that’s one way to get themselves out there, achieve fame, and stay in the limelight. Pamela Anderson has basically made a career out of doing just that. The actress and model first shot to fame as a favorite of Hugh Hefner<i> </i>and then because of her modelling shoots. The natural route of progression was for her to get into the acting industry, and she’s tasted a decent amount of success over the years too. But although that lifestyle brought her success career-wise, it hasn’t really done anything for her from a relationship standpoint. Due to what she’s paid to portray, people know Pamela for one thing. After a while, after that initial fun period, they get bored and discard her – as cruel as it sounds, that’s what it seems like, anyway. At times, she’s managed to entice these guys back, such as Kid Rock and Tommy Lee, who she’s had on-again off-again relationships with. But ultimately, they all end in the same way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cara-delevingne-is-young-but-has-already-got-a-reputation><strong>CARA DELEVINGNE IS YOUNG BUT HAS ALREADY GOT A REPUTATION</strong></h2><p>Cara Delevingne is the top dog in the modelling industry. She’s arguably the most famous model around, and she’s utilized this level of fame&nbsp;to progress to many different things. She’s an actress, and has tried her hand as a fashion designer, singer and musician, and a writer. She’s got plenty of strings to her bow and is revelling at being in the limelight. At the age of 25, she has the world at her feet. Cara has achieved an awful lot for someone of her age. Her personality certainly fits the whole celebrity lifestyle. She’s wild, is really out there, embraces the celebrity lifestyle and everything that comes with it. She’s one of the younger celebrities&nbsp;who are known for getting together, partying, and just having a whale of a time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Living that lifestyle is all well and good, but it’s not great for holding down a decent relationship. Cara has had many relationships over the years and has had her fair share of fun. But to us outsiders looking in, that’s what her relationships seem to be&nbsp;– just about fun. After a while something more is needed, and perhaps Cara’s not ready for that. She’s dated many people over the years, guys and girls. Her current rumored flame is thought to be Paris Jackson. Let’s see if things work out between those two.</p><h2 id=rihanna-really-wants-to-settle-down><strong>RIHANNA REALLY WANTS TO SETTLE DOWN</strong></h2><p>Rihanna is a superstar, plain and simple. She’s one of the greatest musical artists of all time, has been around for a while now but is still going strong, is still wowing people with the songs she releases. Rihanna’s deemed to be one of the most successful, beautiful, and influential women in the world. It’s therefore no surprise that she’s been in many relationships over the years. There are no shortage of guys who want to be with Rihanna. When Rihanna first rose to superstardom, she was another pretty wild woman. She had that typical personality that you see many of the current lot having today. You could certainly say that Rihanna was a party girl. But as she’s hit 30, she’s simmered down a bit on that front, and seems to have put a lid on that lifestyle. Perhaps that may bring with it a change of fortune for her on the dating front. She seems to be ready for a more mature relationship. She has said as much, said she wants to settle down and be a mom. But she doesn’t just want to be a mom. She wants a full family, so that means finding the right baby daddy first.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lopez-is-a-very-head-strong-woman><strong>JENNIFER LOPEZ IS A VERY HEAD-STRONG WOMAN</strong></h2><p>J-Lo’s rise up the ranks to A-list status in the celeb world has been meteoric. She’s had a string of successes in both the music and acting professions, has various other business and philanthropic endeavors, and is a spokeswoman and activist. Due to all she’s achieved, she’s regarded as being one of the most influential women in the world. She’s a strong woman who knows what she wants. People aren’t going to get in the way of her goals. If they’re not good enough, she lets them go. But on the flip side, that attitude could intimidate a lot of men. A combination of the two could be why J-Lo hasn’t had the best of luck when it comes to relationships. She’s been divorced three times and has ended an engagement. Then there are the plethora of other stars she’s had relationships with. She’s currently with ex-MLB star A-Rod, and things look to be going swimmingly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=halle-berry-has-had-bad-luck><strong>HALLE BERRY HAS HAD&nbsp;BAD LUCK</strong></h2><p>It’s hard to find any reason why people keep dumping Halle Berry. To a lot of people, she would be the ideal woman. Of course, she’s beautiful, and we all know what she can do on-screen. From what we know about Halle, she’s also a pretty down-to-earth person, isn’t someone who’s gotten swept away with the celebrity lifestyle she leads. It’s not like she has a wild personality&nbsp;and is always out partying and playing the field. But still, people just haven’t been able to stick with Halle. She’s been married three times over the years and each have been pretty short marriages, the longest one to David Justice lasting five years. It seems as if people jump into things too soon with Halle, then want to do a runner. But at the age of 51 and with a couple of kids, it’s fair to assume Halle desperately wants to settle down and find that special someone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ciara-princess-harris-isn-t-a-princess-to-some><strong>CIARA PRINCESS HARRIS ISN’T A PRINCESS TO SOME</strong></h2><p>Ciara Princess Harris – yes that is her real name – has been in the rap game since the early 2000s. But she’s a woman who’s evolved over the years. Ciara has many strings to her bow, plenty to write on her résumé, including being a singer, songwriter, record producer, dancer and model. She also has plenty of other business interests. Ciara’s one of the most glamorous women in the industry. She’s caught the eyes of many men over the years, and vice versa. Compile a list of those she’s dated and it’d make for impressive reading – actually, not so much for Ciara. She’s had a whole host of famous boyfriends in the past, some of which include 50 Cent, Bow Wow and Trey Songz. Ciara was engaged to Future and is currently hitched to American football quarterback Russell Wilson. It seems inconceivable that Ciara has been dumped and has gone through so many breakups. To ordinary folk like us, why on earth would anyone want to break up with Ciara? Anyway, hopefully she won’t be going through that anymore and is enjoying motherhood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drew-barrymore-is-another-multiple-divorc-e><strong>DREW BARRYMORE IS ANOTHER MULTIPLE DIVORCÉE</strong></h2><p>Drew Barrymore was always going to become an actress. She didn’t really have a say in the matter&nbsp;and was thrust into the profession at a seriously young age. Her parents were both actors, so it was inevitable that Drew was going to follow suit. She grew up around those kinds of people, has been around them pretty much her entire life. You’d therefore think she’d know how to deal with those in the profession and would be able to find someone to settle down with. It hasn’t quite worked out for Drew like that. She’s one of the celebs who’s dated around the most on his list. It’s fair to assume she’s been dumped quite a lot and has done a lot of dumping herself. Drew falls in too deep too quickly. She’s been married and divorced three times, with her longest marriage lasting five years. You’d have thought that someone like Drew wouldn’t have a problem finding a special someone, especially since she’s into both men and women – she has plenty to choose from!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sienna-miller-has-earned-herself-a-rather-unflattering-reputation><strong>SIENNA MILLER HAS EARNED HERSELF A RATHER UNFLATTERING REPUTATION</strong></h2><p>If there’s one celeb on this list who’s dated around the most, it’d have to be Sienna Miller. The blonde bombshell has worked her way through a whole host of celebs, and there have been plenty of scandals along the way. People have gotten burned, including Sienna herself, and there’s been plenty of heartache. Saying that Sienna Miller’s been with a ton of celebs would be an understatement. The actress has been systematically working her way through the celeb world since she came into the limelight. Her most notable relationships were with Daniel Craig, Orlando Bloom and Brad Pitt. She’s been engaged three times but has never been married. She’s used her feminine wiles to get with married men and has been betrayed. Some would say that her getting dumped multiple times is her comeuppance. There aren’t too many people who’d be crying for Sienna, except maybe Sienna herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-is-young-and-having-fun><strong>TAYLOR SWIFT IS YOUNG AND HAVING FUN</strong></h2><p>Look at everything Taylor Swift has achieved and it seems inconceivable that she’s only 28. She’s become one of the best-selling artists of all time, has already established herself as one of the most influential people in the world. People love Taylor, not only because of her music, but because she’s a strong, independent woman who does her own thing, and doesn’t get preoccupied with what others think. If Taylor’s happy, that’s all that matters. She’s had a happy time of things in the dating game too&nbsp;– except when she’s been dumped, of course. But actually, having said that, Taylor strikes me as a woman who wouldn’t mind too much. She’d just dust herself off and get on with it, move on to the next guy. In a way, that’s a rather refreshing attitude to have. She’s young and having fun. But as she gets older, she’ll probably change her mindset and would want to settle down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wild-and-wacky-miley-cyrus><strong>WILD AND WACKY MILEY CYRUS</strong></h2><p>You’d have thought that these younger celebs wouldn’t have featured on this list, and that they wouldn’t have been around long enough to have always been getting dumped. But these celebs in their 20s live fast and loose. They have embraced the partying lifestyle, their celebrity status, and everything that comes with it. Something that comes with it is lots of attention, so it’s pretty easy to fall into a relationship. Miley’s had a string of relationships with both guys and girls. But it’s never ended up working out. Perhaps that’s due to Miley’s wild and wacky personality. She’s one celeb who’s really out there, loves to party, and can be a tad controversial. Initially it might be exciting to be with someone like that. But eventually, as is evident from the number of breakups she’s had, people find that she’s just too feisty to handle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-kardashian-s-lifestyle-isn-t-for-everybody><strong>KIM KARDASHIAN’S LIFESTYLE ISN’T FOR EVERYBODY</strong></h2><p>At the moment, Kim Kardashian’s life is all roses. She’s raking in the cash, is one of the biggest celebrities on the planet, and has a close family. She has great kids and a hubby, and everything seems to be going swimmingly for the reality TV superstar. But it hasn’t always been like that for Kim K, especially on the dating front. Before she got hitched to Kanye West, Kim had a really awful track record when it came to relationships. She’s been divorced twice, and who can forget that disaster of a marriage to Kris Humphries? Thankfully, for all those who love juicy bits of celeb gossip, we got to see most of these relationships play out in front of the cameras on the family’s realty TV show. A lot of people have dumped Kim because they just can’t handle the lifestyle she leads. Reggie Bush, for example, couldn’t deal with the intrusion from the paparazzi&nbsp;or having cameras shoved in his face every time he ventured out of the house.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-wants-to-find-her-ross><strong>JENNIFER ANISTON WANTS TO FIND HER ROSS</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Aniston has been dumped quite a few times over the years. A lot of people just can’t fathom why.&nbsp;Who’d want to dump Jen? Well, us outsiders never know what’s going on behind closed doors, Jen may act like the model celeb, but obviously when it comes to relationships, she’s lacking a little something. We’ll leave that up to your minds as to what that is. Jen’s about to hit the 50 mark, still hasn’t had what she’d and&nbsp;we are sure everybody else would deem to be a successful relationship, and doesn’t have kids, even though she’s said the wants them. She needs to find the right guy first. Brad Pitt certainly wasn’t the right guy. They divorced after five years. Justin Theroux doesn’t seem to be the right guy either. They were married in 2015, but are currently going through a rocky patch and&nbsp;have separated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-is-happy-as-a-single-woman><strong>ANGELINA IS HAPPY AS A SINGLE WOMAN</strong></h2><p>Angelina Jolie is one of the most famous women on the planet. It’s not just her prowess as an actress that gets people talking. Angelina is stunningly beautiful, and is involved in a number of other causes. You’d think that Angelina would have men and women flocking to her, eager to be with her. Once upon a time that was the case, but she’s simmered down a tad on the dating front now. Her priority is her kids. Angelina is actually a self-confessed loner of sorts. She’s admitted she doesn’t have anyone she’d deem to be a friend in the industry. She likes staying at home with her best friends, who are her kids.</p><p>Angelina’s been involved in some pretty weird stuff. She’s had a truly bizarre, colorful love life, one that’s involved a fascination with knives,&nbsp;weird interactions with her brother, and wearing strange vials around her neck. It’s not surprising why Angelina would be too much for a lot of people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kate-hudson-s-been-unlucky-in-love><strong>KATE HUDSON’S BEEN UNLUCKY IN LOVE</strong></h2><p>American actress and businesswoman Kate Hudson has had a very successful time of it over the years. She started out in the industry in her mid-20s and has gone on to make quite a name for herself. She comes from an acting family, so it was inevitable that she was going to follow suit in the same profession, but she’s become the best-known Hudson around. That’s because of her talent as an actress, but also because she’s a beautiful woman. As you’ll know by now, that normally means lots of dates&nbsp;and lots of relationships, but doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going to end up being successful. Kate’s love life is something that’s bound to bring a tear to her eyes. She’s been divorced once and has broken off an engagement. She’s also been dumped by a lot of people over the years. Kate’s personal issues have been well-documented, so perhaps her relationships not working out can be attributed to those problems.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhqYGKzprnApZxmm5WhsqO%2FjLCfqGWTlru1ecWipZ1lnad6s7XGoato</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-fwyb-mean-on-tiktok-and-in-text-messaging-slang-meaning-and-song-lyrics-231701-html.html><span>←</span><span>What Does FWYB Mean On TikTok And In Text Messaging?
