He began serving his sentence in September 2018 at Arizona State Prison Complex and was released several months earlier than his original release date in August.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jorge-Nava-Released-From-Prison-90-day-fiance.jpg><p>The TLC personality had been working on his fitness behind bars and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed his massive weight loss</a> of 128 pounds via Instagram in March. Nava said he shed the weight with a combination of diet and exercise. His daily food plan includes counting calories and intermittent fasting, but the California native <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made sure not to deprive himself.</a></p><p>“I actually do a lot of the eating [from the food] that they do give us [in prison],” Nava <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained to In Touch in April.</a> “But sometimes I do indulge [on the commissary items] and have a cheat day.”</p><p>As for his workout regimen, Nava admitted that fitness has become “almost like an addiction” for him while he’s been serving his time.</p><p>“Yeah, I actually started working out with other people that have been training and doing bodybuilding and stuff,” Nava said. “So, I have pretty good coaches in here.”</p><p>Nava appeared on season 4 of 90 Day Fiancé in 2016 with his wife, <strong>Anfisa Arkhipchenko</strong>, whom he met on Facebook. Nava’s rep confirmed to Us Weekly in March that he plans to file for divorce from the Russia native, 24.</p><p>The reality star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thinks Arkhipchenko was uncomfortable</a> when he shared his massive <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> on social media.</p><p>“I think she was just jealous of the attention that I was getting. The news about my weight loss didn’t sit with her very well,” he also told In Touch.</p><p>Arkhipchenko, for her part, has moved on with her boyfriend, Leo Assaf. The model went Instagram official with her new beau in March with a selfie captioned, “Quarantine and chill?”</p><p>Nava shared that being in prison <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made his marriage “very difficult.”</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“One of the first things I had to deal with was leaving my family and leaving my relationship behind. That was hard,” Nava said during an April <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">episode of 90 Day Fiancé: Self-Quarantined</a>. “The last time I saw Anfisa was the day before I got incarcerated. The night before I came to prison, we had an argument and things were not going well.”</p><p>He added, “I thought I was going to try to make things work, and they didn’t. That was it. Probably about two months after I was in prison, she basically told me that she couldn’t be with me anymore. She wishes I got 12 years in prison, basically trying to get rid of me. We still talked on the phone. I tried to work on the relationship no matter what. I tried.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGZyaF2Zrrp5xaKYp5uVqHqru9GgnGamkauubr7EpZyaq5WZeqe%2BzqZkqaqZqLyvec%2Bhpq2no2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./martha-levert-lifestyle-age-eddie-leverts-wife-biography-family-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Martha Levert Lifestyle, Age (Eddie Leverts Wife) Biography, Family, Facts</span></a>
