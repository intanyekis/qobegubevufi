You’re safe here son! I Love you, Popz, Your Biological.” He closed with the medium-brown toned raised-fist emoji and tagged his Health Equity in Transplantation Coalition organization.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1061595632.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Quincy Brown was raised by Diddy, legal name Sean Combs, as a co-parent when his mother Kim Porter was in a relationship with the Bad Boys Entertainment mogul. The message from Al B. Sure!, legal name Albert Joseph Brown III, to his son comes as Combs faces investigation from Homeland Security for sex trafficking.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.vibe.com/news/national/diddy-homes-raided-homeland-security-sex-trafficking-investigation-1234864174/>Earlier this week, </a>both Combs’ Miami and Los Angeles residences were raided by federal law enforcement. Homeland Security expert Hal Kempfer detailed <a href=#>the searched evidence</a>&nbsp;included “laptops, flash drives, and anything that would connect Combs with the allegations.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Comb’s other sons Justin and Christian Combs were among the people who were reportedly home during the raid. Combs’&nbsp;Attorney Aaron Dyer released a statement calling the raids “a gross use of military-level force,” hammering down on his client’s professed innocence.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>FOX 11 reporting from the Los Angeles home of Sean Diddy Combs as it was raided by Homeland Security; there were people home at the time: <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/9ZqGC0mJLs</a></p>— philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) <a href=# rel=nofollow>March 25, 2024</a><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The bust was carried out as Combs faces multiple lawsuits and accusations of sexual assault, rape, abuse, and other&nbsp;<a href=#>heinous crimes&nbsp;</a>by multiple women, including his<a href=#> ex-girlfriend, singer&nbsp;Cassie Ventura.</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The initial lawsuit filed by Ventura, which made claims of sexual assault,&nbsp;abuse, and&nbsp;rape, was settled within two days, however, made the public aware of the alleged crimes committed behind-the-scenes by the Harlem native and opened the door for more alleged victims to speak out.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">At the time, Al B. Sure! shared a <a href=#>cryptic note</a> to social media, writing, “I do agree my expectations about you were driven strictly from my optimistic view of you, hoping your grimy ways would dissipate with age and or the current state of affairs that will eventually expose that you were on the payroll and secretly part of the shenanigans. Undo the puzzle.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Take a look at Al B.
