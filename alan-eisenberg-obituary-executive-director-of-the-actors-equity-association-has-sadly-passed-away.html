It was Mr. Eisenberg’s 88th year. Mr. Eisenberg was born and raised in Brighton Beach, which is located in the borough of Brooklyn. While attending the University of Michigan, he majored in English and published a sports column for the Michigan Daily.</p><p>After graduating from New York University’s School of Law, Mr. Eisenberg worked in the 1960s New York counterculture as an espresso operator at Café Figaro. He also practiced law at this time. His next move was to pursue a career in labor law. He explained this decision to the American Jewish Committee while they were meeting in the New York Public Library. He said, “If I was going to be a lawyer, I decided I was going to be a labor lawyer because it had an inherent drama to it, like literature.” Since 1981, Mr. Eisenberg has combined his love of the arts with his passion for the labor movement to lead the actors’ union through tremendous membership growth and several controversies.</p><p>These controversies include the 1990 Miss Saigon controversy, the industry’s uncertain times after September 11, 2001, and increased non-union touring. Mr. Eisenberg has led the union through all of these storms. When Mr. Eisenberg retired in 2005, the membership of the union increased from 28,678 to 46,000, the earnings of stage managers and players increased from $118.6 million to $250.3 million, and the value of the equity assets increased from $1.7 million to over $22 million. In order to provide more content to audiences across the country, Mr. Eisenberg and Equity President Patrick Quinn conceived of the Experimental Touring Program, which is included in the Production Contract.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZK6trc1mnKKrlaOvpr7GZqaboaSqrrPFjJ6vnpulqba3sYydoKudk6m8s3nOn2StoJVirqTAzquqZp2hqra1xYyaqqynk56utbXOp2ShmaNiwKKwy7JkqZmjqLKlecCwmLJn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wyatt-lewis-parents-meet-cy-fair-hs-graduates-father-and-mother-652505-html.html><span>←</span><span>Wyatt Lewis Parents: Meet Cy-Fair HS Graduates Father and Mother</span></a>
