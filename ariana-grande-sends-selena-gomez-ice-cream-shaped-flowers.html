Grande was actually one of the writers of “Ice Cream,” along with Gomez, <strong>Victoria Monét</strong>, <strong>Teddy Park</strong>, <strong>Tommy Brown</strong> and <strong>Bekuh BOOM</strong>.</p><p>On Saturday, August 29, the Monte Carlo star shared a behind-the-scenes Instagram clip from the music video shoot. “BLACKPINK, they’re very known for their videos and they’re known for their personalities, so I felt like I got to step into their world a little bit,” Gomez explained, noting that the artists weren’t actually able to shoot the music video together due to the <a href=#>COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p><p>“I wish that I was there with them,” she added, noting that she loves the quartet. “I guarantee you there’s this synergy that we could have if we could be in the same place, but we’re being safe.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though the video shoot didn’t go exactly as planned, Gomez celebrated the debut of the tune a tad early on Thursday, August 27, by whipping up her own elaborate dessert. “To celebrate the final episodes of Selena + Chef Season 1 on @hbomax and the release of ICE CREAM, I made a little extra recipe,” she captioned a video of herself creating the epic sweet treat, which was made with her own ice cream flavor.</p><p>Three days earlier, the “Lose You to Love Me” songstress announced that she was ice cream brand Serendipity’s newest investor. Her aforementioned flavor, which was designed to mark the premiere of “Ice Cream,” is called <a href=#>Cookies & Cream Remix</a>. It’s made with pink vanilla ice cream, crunchy cookie bites and fudge swirls.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZpqqmZa7onnGq5innJViwKa6w6xkrJ2cmruiecaopJ6yXZ6wpnnCq5yapV2otaK8xJ1kn6SfrLKzv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-pics-dana-white-doesnt-want-you-to-see-of-these-ufc-stars.html><span>←</span><span>15 Pics Dana White Doesnt Want You To See Of These UFC Stars</span></a>
