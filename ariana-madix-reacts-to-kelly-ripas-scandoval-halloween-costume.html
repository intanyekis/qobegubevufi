This is insane.’”</p><p>Ripa, 53, and her husband, 52, wore multiple costumes during the Tuesday episode of their show, and one of their looks was a cheeky take on the Bravo scandal that rocked reality TV earlier this year. Ripa dressed as Madix in a blonde wig and red dress, while Consuelos donned a mustache to channel Madix’s ex <a href=#><strong>Tom Sandoval</strong></a>.</p><p>Us confirmed in March that Madix and Sandoval, 41, called it quits after Madix discovered Sandoval was having an affair with their <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> costar <a href=#><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a>. Madix and Sandoval had been dating for nine years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ariana-Madix-Reacts-to-Kelly-Ripa-and-Mark-Consuelos-Incredible-Scandoval-Spoof-01.jpg><p>Madix — who was named Us Weekly’s <a href=#>Reality Star of the Year</a> last month — recently told Us that the breakup and its aftermath <a href=#>made her proud</a> of her “ability to survive.” She went on to say that joining the cast of DWTS season 32 is “the most daring thing” she’s done recently.</p><p>During the Tuesday episode of the dancing competition series, Madix and her partner, <a href=#><strong>Pasha Pashkov</strong></a>, finished at the top of the leaderboard <a href=#>after Monster Night</a>, scoring three 9s and a 10. Judge <a href=#><strong>Carrie Ann Inaba</strong></a> was so impressed that she told Madix she could be the contestant to win the mirrorball trophy this season.</p><p>“Carrie Ann is a tough critic. I know she doesn’t say that lightly,” <a href=#>Madix told Us</a> after her performance. “I just hope that in the coming weeks I can prove her right.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ariana-Madix-Reacts-to-Kelly-Ripa-and-Mark-Consuelos-Incredible-Scandoval-Spoof-02.jpg><p>Madix went on to say that it was “crazy amazing” to get such positive feedback from Inaba, 55. “I was like, ‘What’s happening?’” she told Us. “I just don’t want to let her down after saying that. I just want to keep getting better … Two weeks from now, I hope to still be here and have her be like, ‘I was right.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Dancing With the Stars airs on ABC and Disney+ Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Hannah Kahn</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJiroZGjrm65wJ2gsWWimq6kwNJmq6hlm5q5rcWMq6CpmaNiwKStzZ2mr5mcYrWiuMuorp6dnmKwsL%2FTrqSeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./no-shot-jason-kelce-plays-in-2024-eagles-jordan-mailata.html><span>←</span><span>'No shot' Jason Kelce plays in 2024: Eagles' Jordan Mailata</span></a>
