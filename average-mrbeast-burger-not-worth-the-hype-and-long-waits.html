He and buddies Nick, Joe and Anthony, who’ve all faithfully followed MrBeast’s online antics since around the time the internet bigwig first began sharing content in 2017, waited in line for 12 hours for first bites of his burgers during the eatery’s massive launch. The pack of pals admire MrBeast for his charitable contributions to the community at large and were eager to support his patty-flipping endeavors.</p><p>“We had the Beast-style burger [at the opening] and it was good enough for us to come back,” said Matthew, with a laugh. “I want to try the Beast-style fries this time.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">MrBeast Burger’s burger failed to meet viral expectations despite its 50,000-person opening Sept. 4. <span class=credit>NYPost Composite</span></figure><p>But, to me, the basket of French fries, covered in basic condiments, wimpy cheese sauce and a few slices of pickle were also disappointing. With a name like “beast,” the crinkle cuts could have been crispier and the toppings much more ferociously zesty.&nbsp;</p><p>Gus Garcia, a 64-year-old MrBeast fan from northern New Jersey, shared my views on the food’s “just alright” taste.</p><p>But he told The Post that he didn’t mind <a href=#>shelling out a few bucks</a> for the viral vittles, owing to the hot shot’s philanthropic works, including the launch of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">food pantries </a>across the US and aid to Ukraine amid the war<a href=#>.&nbsp;</a></p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">MrBeast launched his burger line virtually in 2020. <span class=credit>Getty Images for MrBeast Burger</span></figure><p>“The burgers are not the best,” said Garcia as he and his wife waited on the line that spilled out into the halls of the mall.&nbsp;“But I really like the work he’s done to help others. I watch him [often] and he seems like a real good guy.”</p><p>Long Island parents Gary and Rebecca, whose 10-year-old daughter Ella dragged them to the noshery, told The Post that they “can’t stand” MrBeast due to his annoying voice and <a href=#>goofy capers</a>.</p><p>In fact, whenever Ella watches his clips, she’s forced to go upstairs in her room and out of mom and dad’s earshot.&nbsp;</p><p>But, the pair explained to The Post that they agreed to wait on line at the guy’s restaurant with their little girl because of the charitable work he’s done for the environment such as removing 30 million pounds of trash from the ocean via his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Team Seas</a> cleanup initiative.&nbsp;</p><p>“The kids love him. Parents can take him in small doses,” said Gary, with a chuckle. “But if the burger’s good, I may consider coming back a second time.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3Jma29flsOmvsCgnGalopeyor%2FTZpmuqpeav266zq1ksKeiqbVuwMeeZKGxoJp6orrDZqOoppdixKK106xm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-female-celebs-who-cant-find-mr-right.html><span>←</span><span>20 Female Celebs Who Can't Find Mr. Right</span></a>
