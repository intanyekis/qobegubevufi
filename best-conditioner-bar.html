<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>The Best Conditioner Bar of 2024</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/conditioner-bar-promo.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 class=section-title>What Are the Benefits of Conditioner Bars?</h2><p>Liquid cleansers are more common than bars, but with liquid cleansers, it’s a lot easier to end up using more product than you need each time you wash your hair. Liquids typically come in plastic bottles or tubes that not only take up more space, but also produce a lot of plastic waste that isn’t great for the environment. Bars are a waste-free, environmentally friendly alternative.</p><p>The consistency of bars provides greater moisture and decreases waste. Plus, their compact size makes them travel-friendly and easy to use. Most of them are made of entirely safe, organic, and non-toxic ingredients.</p><p>One of the best perks about these bars is the <a href=# rel=noopener aria-describedby=audioeye_new_window_message>number of washes</a>&nbsp;you can get from a single one. A conditioner bar priced the same (or even lower) than a liquid conditioner will last you a much longer time, even if you use it daily.</p><h2 class=section-title>What to Look For and Avoid in a Conditioner Bar</h2><h3>Hair-boosting elements</h3><p>Look for bars that contain natural <strong>essential oils</strong> and <strong>henna</strong> to nourish dry and damaged hair. These active ingredients will target specific issues in your hair to work toward making your hair stronger, smoother, and healthier overall.</p><h3>Silicone-free</h3><p>Silicone will accumulate in the skin on your scalp over time, making the roots of your hair greasy. It will also leave your hair feeling coarse and unruly over time. If you have curls, silicone will flatten them out, which is why you need to look for bars with ingredients like shea butter, emollient oils, and essential oils.</p><h3>Synthetic preservatives</h3><p>Silicone and parabens are synthetic ingredients that are typically added to beauty care products because they extend shelf life and aren’t too costly. These ingredients affect the hormonal balance in your body in various ways, which is why many of them are called hormone disruptors. Avoid bars that contain these ingredients.</p><h3>Sulfate-free</h3><p>Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) are both extremely strong surfactants that are used as thickening and emulsifying agents. They’re commonly found in conditioners and are <strong>known to strip your hair and scalp of natural oil</strong>. In doing so, they leave your hair looking rough and dull.</p><h3>Fatty alcohols</h3><p>You’re going to need some fatty alcohols in your hair. Some useful fatty alcohols include glycerin and cetyl alcohol, which are referred to as “good” alcohols because they serve as natural conditioners. Short-chain alcohols (like isopropyl alcohol) are “bad” alcohols because they dry out your hair and make the cuticle rougher. These alcohols should be avoided entirely.</p><h3>Plastic-free packaging</h3><p>It’s extremely easy to avoid using plastic when wrapping and packaging conditioner bars. Unlike liquid conditioners, conditioner bars don’t need to be placed in plastic to be stored and delivered. The packaging of these bars should be 100% plastic-free and made entirely of paper that can be recycled and composted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6eyt7XEsKpompWowW6vzqeboqyZpLumvoybmKtn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pep-up-crossword-clue.html><span>←</span><span>Pep up Crossword Clue and Answer</span></a>
