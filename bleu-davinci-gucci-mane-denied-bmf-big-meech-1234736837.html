Allegedly, Guwop wasn’t allowed into the collective due to his known reputation as a robber.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Gucci’s a street ni**a. He just be outside all the time and sh*t,” DaVinci told Cam Capone News in a clip posted on Tuesday (Feb. 21). “Gucci was like a part-time jack boy, part-time dope dealer, part-time rapper. Gucci was a slash man. I knew Gucci before I knew Jeezy.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bleu, <a href=# id=auto-tag_bmf data-tag=bmf>BMF</a>‘s sole rapper signee in the early 2000s, went on to describe how Meech was well aware of the Atlanta rapper and how he would stand in clubs looking for people to rob. This ultimately determined the Detroit kingpin’s decision to not align himself with the 1017 Records leader.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“He was cool, and he used to try to get down with the mob, but Meech was telling ni**as like, ‘Nah man, this ni**a be out here robbing ni**as and sh*t. We can’t have no ni**as that’s known robbers.’”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Despite the fact his perception was a hindrance, they still had a lot of respect for him.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Ni**as knew he would get down on a ni**a type shit. So we kinda wasn’t doing that at the time. He always just been a friendly and always been the homie.” This amicable relationship allowed Gucci Mane to still work with BMF in some capacity, as the collective played a role in his breakout single “So Icy” featuring <a href=#>Jeezy</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e5psGMnZivoZ6Ytm6z1JyaomWdlrumecOepaKdlGKvrrKMm6CgZZ2asqS0jGppbGxnaIN5f5Zo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./phil-robertson-siblings.html><span>←</span><span>Phil Robertson Siblings: A Look at the Hunter's Equally Outlandish Siblings</span></a>
