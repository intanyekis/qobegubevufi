In a post she reposted from his Instagram, he calls her “genius,” and attests that even though they’ve “already healed many thru song” prior to the picture, they are now “onto chasing each other around the world.” Brandy claims that she “sees God in [his] eyes.” Possibly a connection to let us know the two artists are expecting together? We’ll leave that to Brandy and Sir The Baptist to confirm themselves.</p><p>But former Moesha cast mate, Countess Vaughn did comment on the initial post: “Congrats on the baby I’m soooooo happy for you and I love you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screenshot-481-1495471941.png><p>Nothing is really over until the (possibly) pregnant lady sings a note of the truth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e%2ForrDsmSpqpWcu6K6wrJkq62dpL9ugZBsaHJtXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sam-heughan-girlfriend-4665510.html><span>←</span><span>All About The Special Women In His Life Hollywood Life</span></a>
