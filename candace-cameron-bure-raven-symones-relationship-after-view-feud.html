It also doesn't seem like they were friends before the discussion.

She said that she didn't talk about politics and was told that wouldn't be the focal point. As fans know, that didn't end up being the case and the co-hosts get into political conversations frequently, which is definitely a reason why there are so many fights. According to The New York Post, she said, “First of all, they told me this wasn’t going to be politically oriented when they revamped it. So, [I was] catfished for one.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/fans-wanted-to-cancel-the-view-after-humiliating-melissa-rauch-front-instar-back-the-view_-youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Fans Wanted To Cancel The View After Humiliating Melissa Rauch">Fans Wanted To Cancel The View After Humiliating Melissa Rauch</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Fans think Joy Behar didn't treat Melissa Rauch with respect on The View.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Candace Cameron Bure talked about The View</a> on the same podcast.
