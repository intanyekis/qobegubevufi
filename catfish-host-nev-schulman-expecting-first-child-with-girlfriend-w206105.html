I’m having a baby!” Accompanying his tweet was Perlongo’s post entitled, “‘Pregnant? You’re Keeping It? Ew.’ and Other Reactions,” leading with a photo of Schulman holding her arm as a doctor performs an ultrasound.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/nev-schulman-a304e2e5-23d7-4d80-9d24-51674015b1b6.jpg><p>In the post, Perlongo spares no details, revealing that she was high on a pot gummy when she took a pregnancy test. “Hi. My name is Laura Perlongo and I’m pregnant accidentally on purpose,” she wrote. “Here’s what happened… It was a low-key Saturday night in February. I had taken a gummy with my boyfriend. Well, I guess first I had condom-less, birth control-free sex where the white stuff got inside the vaginal pocket, but a couple weeks later I ate marijuana in the form of candy.”</p><p>Perlongo says it was in that moment she decided to take a pregnancy test — which came up with two lines, meaning she’s pregnant. “That’s more than one line. And I’m 30. I have 15 years of urine-on-stick experience. There was no digging out instructions or googling necessary. No franticly peeing on more tests to confirm a result,” she recalled. “We had talked about wanting kids and had pulled the goalie maybe half-a-time-once but weren’t necessarily expecting this news, THE NEWS.”</p><span class=caption></span><p><span>The expectant mom says reality sunk in after the weed wore off. “I knew right away I wanted this baby. I was strong. I was smart. I was full of love. I COULD DO THIS!” she shared. “I was confident I’d be great. Nev was confident he would be great. HE COULD DO THIS! Sure we’d only been dating long-distance 7 months (with a break in August) but we were optimistic and in love. It felt as good a time as ever. (And who knows if/when there would ever be a ‘better’ time.) We were excited.”</span></p><p>Perlongo continued, “I’m writing this because I believe baby-making times are strange for the growing population of girls like me,” she noted. “To make a long letter short, Nev and I certainly have no idea what we’re doing, we just know we’re doing something we want to be doing. Hopefully we don’t suck at it or turn into know-it-all zombies. Mainly we’re just really happy and excited.”</p><p>Schulman followed up with <a href=#>another photo of himself kissing her </a>on the forehead at the hospital. “IT’S A GIRL!,” he wrote on Instagram. “No words can capture the excitement and joy I feel about becoming a father. I am so in love with you @el_peego and thank you for giving me this incredible gift. You inspire and excite me every day.”</p><p><span>Schulman is proof that life can change dramatically in one year. </span><a href=#>In an exclusive interview with <i>Us Weekly</i></a><i> </i><span>in March 2015, the MTV host revealed that he was single at the time but not fishing for love on online dating apps. “I’m single,” he said to </span><i>Us</i><span> at the time. “I have never been on or used any dating websites. I’ve been in relationships for a long time, and maybe it’s just because I’ve met wonderful women offline.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He and Perlongo made their red carpet debut last September at the NYC premiere of <i>The Intern.</i></span></p><p><span>Schulman was famously catfished in 2009 by Angela Wesselman, a woman who was posing as a person named Megan on Facebook. The entire relationship was fabricated by Wesselman to lure in Schulman, who then detailed his experience in his famous 2010 documentary. </span><i>Catfish</i><span> was such a success that it subsequently birthed a popular MTV series of the same name.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacmaSbtrS0jKGmrKxdo7K3edKcn66knZa7brHXqZycrJmjtG6yyKuqrWWTnbatsIywoK2gXZy2s7jFq6CeppRixHN8lWpnbmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wendell.html><span>←</span><span>Wendell - Player profile 2024</span></a>
