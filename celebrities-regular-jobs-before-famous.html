A licensed physician in California (though non-practicing), Ken now plays a doctor on his ABC show Dr. Ken.&nbsp; And he did once actually <a href=#>leap off the stage to save a woman</a> who was having a seizure during a stand-up set.&nbsp; Wow!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sting-was-a-teacher>Sting Was A Teacher</h2><p>In the hit by the Police, Don't Stand So Close to Me, Sting sang of a "young teacher, the subject of schoolgirl fantasy."&nbsp; He was definitely singing about himself!&nbsp; Before Gordon Sumner became Sting, he was known as Mr. Sumner, English teacher and soccer coach, at the St. Paul's school in Cramlington, England.&nbsp; When his band the Police hit it big in the 1980s, his career as an educator was a distant past.&nbsp; But he continued to support teachers by speaking up for higher teacher pay in order to attract quality people to the profession</p><h2 id=melissa-mccarthy-was-a-starbucks-barista>Melissa McCarthy Was A Starbucks Barista</h2><p>Melissa McCarthy may be one of <a href=#>Hollywood's highest-paid actresses</a>, but when she first started out, she was broke and didn't have a car.&nbsp; So she took a job at Starbucks, which was walking distance from where she lived.&nbsp; In fact, she once made coffee for one of her heroes, Chris Farley, while working there and was tongue-tied and starstruck.&nbsp; After her TV show Molly and Mike and star turn in The Bridesmaids, Melissa is the one making people starstruck now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brad-pitt-wore-a-chicken-suit>Brad Pitt Wore A Chicken Suit</h2><p>Brad Pitt seems to have been the Sexiest Man Alive forever.&nbsp; But when he left the University of Missouri just a few credits shy of a journalism degree to pursue his Hollywood dreams, he didn't hit success right away.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>10 Ridiculously Expensive Things That Brad Pitt Bought</a></span></p><p>While struggling as an actor, Brad took odd jobs, like working as a limo driver.
