Just a year after&nbsp;Seth and Mark Gold founded the company, Mars quickly became an investor for the tropical drinks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Best Celebrity Makeup Lines (Including Lady Gaga's Haus Lab)</a></span></p><p>"SelvaRay's Coconut delivers the ultimate drink every time," the singer said in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>, "It’s hands down the best coconut rum you’ve ever tasted. Who wouldn’t be happy with a SelvaRey Piña Colada in their hand."</p><p>Mars quickly became the face of the brand's marketing as the singer's signature drink,&nbsp;Owner’s Reserve sold out within two hours of its release.</p><p>Most recently, Mars brought along the talents of chart hitting friends to help brand SelvaRay's new drink,&nbsp;Tropical Luxury. Silk Sonic and Anderson Paak joined forces yet again with Mars to be featured in an ad that showcased the abundant fun that Tropical Punch has in store for all our kickback necessities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kendell-jennifer-s-818-tequila>Kendell Jennifer's 818 Tequila</h2><p>You wouldn't be keeping up with the Kardashians if you weren't clued into all the money moves that go on in the family. The most recent on being: Kendell Jennifer's new <a href=#>line of tequila</a></p><p>While most fans know Kendell for stomping down the catwalk, she step her toes into the booze business when she announces 818 Tequila on her Instagram.</p><p>For almost 4 years I've been on a journey to create the best-tasting tequila . . .&nbsp;3.5 years later i think we've done it," Kendell writes to her 170 million followers.</p><p>"This is all we've been drinking for the last year," she goes on to say, "and i can't wait for everyone else to get their hands on this to enjoy it as much as we do."</p><p>Named after the Kardashian's area code back in Calabasas, the brand comes in threw different flavors:&nbsp;Reposado, Blanco, and&nbsp;Anejo. The drink has actually created quite the buzz around the tequila competition circuit. Kendall anonymously submitted 818 to several different contest and placed pretty highly in a few.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"By all means, if you can get your hands on a bottle, definitely do. Then slide a glass our way," a judge tells <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.</p><p>Though, lately, it has been all peaches and cream for Kendall's newest business venture. 818 Tequila has been the subject of much scrutiny these past few weeks by people claiming that Kendall is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">appropriating&nbsp;Latin culture</a>&nbsp;Not only do they disapprove of Kendall capitalizing off a product that is not of her heritage, they also believe that celebrity brands such as the funnel profits from consumers that would better go towards smaller businesses.</p><p>Her family's questionable comments and the fact that her team refused to speak upon the issue might not be the best look for Kendall.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan-reynolds-and-aviation-american-gin>Ryan Reynolds and Aviation American Gin</h2><p>Aviation American Gin, a Portland based liquor brand, was founded by Christian Krogstad and Ryan Magarian in 2008. Though the face of the brand today is that of Hollywood leading man, Ryan Reynolds.</p><p>The actor first dived into the liquor business when he acquired a minority stake at an undisclosed amount from Davos Brands. Thus, he became the brand's co-owner.</p><p>"I've tried every gin on the planet and Aviation is, hands down, the best," says Reynolds' on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">brand's website</a>, "Also, I don't recommend trying every gin on the planet. Stick with this one."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the site, Aviation is made from a "proprietary maceration recipe that produces a pure medley of botanical flavor." It surely must do the trick as Aviation is currently the country's second biggest super premium gin, with brand's growth volume reaching higher than 100%. This caught the eye of alcoholic beverage distributor, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Diago</a>, who bought Aviation for a whopping&nbsp;$610 million.</p><p>&nbsp;Reynolds remains as a prominent figure in the company. For Father's Day, Reynolds and his creative agency,&nbsp;Maximum Effort made a special video to showcase the company's new drink, "The Vasectomy".</p><h2 id=snoop-dog-s-snoop-cali-ros>Snoop Dog's&nbsp;Snoop Cali Rosé</h2><p>He's not all smoke and reefers! Believe it or not, the legendary 'Doggfather', Snoop Dog has actually made huge waves in the wine industry through the past few years.</p><p>When China placed nearly 200% of tariffs on Australian alcoholic beverages, the great Down Under soon found itself in a bit of a pickle. This saw major losses from companies like&nbsp;Treasury Wine Estates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luckily, Snoop was there to save the day! He recently became the ambassador of Treasury's brand and helped promote one 19 Crimes. 19 Crimes is line of wine that takes inspiration from Austrian felonies of the past that in turn became colonist.</p><p>This unlikely paring of a LA rapper and bespoke, European wine brand worked perfectly as their first collaboration, Snoop Cali Red became the&nbsp;top-selling wine innovation of 2020. Earlier this year, Snoop turned it up a notch with the launch of the brand's newest drink: Snoop Cali Rose.</p><p>"We did it big with 19 Crimes Cali Red, so you know we had to do it again," the rapper boasts in a statement, "and this time, I was thinking pink. I can’t wait for everyone to sip on my Snoop Cali Rosé and bring those fresh feels from spring into summer and beyond."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With a fruity&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blend</a> of&nbsp;Zinfandel, Grenache and Pinot Noir, Treasury releases this drink to ride the phenomenon of celebrity branded wines.
