They may also recover more quickly from strokes. An older article in the American Journal of Psychology suggests that <b>left</b>–<b>handed people</b> may be better at divergent thinking, a thought process used to generate creative ideas.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-left-handers-have-higher-iq></span>Do left handers have higher IQ?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>No differences in mean <b>IQ</b> scores were found between right-<b>handers</b> and non-right-<b>handers</b> as well as between right-<b>handers</b> and mixed-<b>handers</b>. No relationship differences were found. Overall, the <b>intelligence</b> differences between <b>handedness</b> groups in the general population are negligible.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-left-handers-think-differently></span>Do left handers think differently?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>However, results from a 2009 study by Stanford University concluded that <b>left</b>–<b>handed</b> people may indeed <b>think different</b> to those who are right <b>handed</b>, or at least, they see the world a little <b>differently</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-personality-traits-of-left-handed-people></span>What are the personality traits of left-handed people?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>So for all of you <b>lefties</b>, leftie-loving righties, and ambidextrous folks out there — it’s time to brush up on your <b>left</b>–<b>handed</b> knowledge and help put an end to leftie discrimination once and for all. Subscribe to our lifestyle email. <b>Lefties</b> make up about 10 percent of the general <b>population</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-being-left-handed-rare></span>Is being left-handed rare?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Left</b>–<b>handedness</b> is far less common than right-<b>handedness</b>. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of people are <b>left</b>–<b>handed</b>. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant <b>hand</b>. This is very <b>uncommon</b>, with about a 1% prevalence.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-being-left-handed-a-birth-defect></span>Is being left-handed a birth defect?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Summary: <b>Left</b>–<b>handedness</b> is sometimes the expression of a genetic <b>defect</b> or an early developmental disturbance. <b>Left</b>–<b>handedness</b> is sometimes the expression of a genetic <b>defect</b> or an early developmental disturbance.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-left-handed-bad></span>Why is left-handed bad?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Due to cultural and social pressures, many <b>left</b>–<b>handed</b> children were forced to write and perform other activities with their right hands. This conversion can cause multiple problems in the developing <b>left</b>–<b>handed</b> child, including learning disorders, dyslexia, stuttering and other speech disorders.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-causes-someone-to-be-left-handed></span>What causes someone to be left-handed?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Fetal development – some researchers believe that <b>handedness</b> has more of an environmental influence than genetic. They propose that environmental factors in the womb (including exposure to hormones) may influence whether we favour the right or <b>left hand</b> later in life.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-cons-of-being-left-handed></span>What are the cons of being left-handed?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>On the flip side, <b>lefties</b> have some <b>disadvantages</b> too.</b><ul class=i8Z77e><li class=TrT0Xe><b>Lefties</b> are more worried about making mistakes, more sensitive to criticism and are easily embarrassed.</li><li class=TrT0Xe><b>Lefties</b> are quick to anger.</li><li class=TrT0Xe><b>Left</b>–<b>handed</b> people have a higher risk of brain disorders like schizophrenia, dyslexia or hyperactivity disorders.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-left-handed-people-born-that-way></span>Are left-handed people born that way?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>What makes humanity’s bias against <b>lefties</b> all the more unfair is that <b>left</b>–<b>handed people</b> are <b>born that way</b>. In fact, scientists have speculated for years that a single gene could control a <b>left</b>–<b>right</b> preference in humans. Unfortunately, they just couldn’t pinpoint exactly where the gene might lie.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-does-being-left-handed-affect-a-child-development></span>How does being left-handed affect a child development?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>One potentially important determinant of a <b>child’s</b> cognitive <b>development</b> is the preference for using the <b>left</b> or right <b>hand</b>. <b>Left</b>– or mixed-<b>handedness</b> has been associated with atypical cognitive abilities, which can have both disadvantageous and advantageous outcomes (Heilman 2005).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-left-handed-people-more-angry></span>Are left-handed people more angry?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Lefties</b> get angrier<p>A study in The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease suggested that those who <b>are left</b>–<b>handed</b> are <b>more</b> prone to negative emotions. It also found that when processing emotions, <b>lefties</b> have a <b>greater</b> imbalance in activity between the <b>left</b> and right brains.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-fear-of-left-handed-people></span>What is the fear of left handed people?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Sinistrophobia is a <b>fear</b> of objects to the <b>left</b> side of bodies or <b>left</b>–<b>handed people</b>. The word sinistrophobia is derived from the Latin word sinistro (meaning <b>left</b>) and the Greek word <b>phobia</b> (meaning <b>fear</b>).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=was-the-tribe-of-benjamin-left-handed></span>Was the tribe of Benjamin left handed?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Several passages in the Bible describe <b>tribe of Benjamin</b> as being pugnacious, for example in the Song of Deborah, and in descriptions where they are described as being taught to fight <b>left handed</b>, so as to be able to wrong foot their enemies (Judges 3:15–21, 20:16, 1 Chronicles 12:2) and where they are portrayed as<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=was-elvis-presley-right-or-left-handed></span>Was Elvis Presley right or left handed?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Presley</b> scrawled the signature with his <b>left hand</b> because he had broken a finger on his <b>right hand</b> playing touch football earlier that day. “It may be the only <b>left</b>–<b>handed</b> signature he ever wrote,″ fraternity member Shawn Mangrum said Thursday, the day the box was opened _ one day after <b>Presley’s</b> birthday.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-fraternity-was-elvis></span>What fraternity was Elvis?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The signature of <b>Elvis Presley</b> appears on a membership scroll for Tau Kappa Epsilon, which made the King an honorary member on Oct. 24, 1960.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-tke-stand-for></span>What does TKE stand for?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Tau Kappa Epsilon</b> (ΤΚΕ), commonly known as <b>TKE</b> or Teke, is a social college fraternity founded on January 10, 1899, at Illinois Wesleyan University. The organization has chapters throughout the United States and Canada, making it an international organization.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46cn5qqkZjBpr7IrKuim6NivKd5y56drWWYlrulscNmp56noKGycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alaina-marie-mathers-biography-net-worth-parents-brother-high-school-and-songs-of-eminems-daughter.html><span>←</span><span>Alaina Marie Mathers Biography; Net Worth, Parents, Brother, High School And Songs Of Eminems Dau</span></a>
