On top of that, even some fans of the franchise have their own issues including those who believe <a href=#>Teen Mom 2 is overly scripted</a>. With all of that in mind, some people may conclude that the Teen Mom fan community doesn’t really care about what is best for the franchise’s stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is Teen Mom: The Next Chapter?</a></span></p><p>Of course, there is no denying that Teen Mom fans enjoy the drama as evidenced by all of the attention <a href=#>the franchise’s scandals</a> consistently get. However, the truth is that most Teen Mom fans want the show’s stars to have happy and healthy lives.</p><p>As a result, when Teen Mom 2’s Chelsea DeBoer (née Houska) lost a lot of weight, many franchise fans wanted to know what was going on with her.</p><h2 id=the-dark-truth-about-the-way-the-masses-judge-female-celebrities>The Dark Truth About The Way The Masses Judge Female Celebrities</h2><p>Anyone who pays even a little bit of attention to the modern media landscape is bound to notice something very disturbing. When it comes to women in the public eye, there is no winning when it comes to their bodies.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Photos That Change The Way We See The Teen Moms Cast</a></span></p><p>If members of the public decide that a female star is too thin, a lot of people claim they must suffer from anorexia and they get harshly judged on social media. If a female star is overweight, they also get judged on social media in a lot of different ways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though female stars who are deemed overweight or too thin get a lot of flack, in a lot of cases they are treated even worse if they make a change.</p><p>If a thin celebrity puts on some pounds, they will continue to be judged any time photos make it seems like they dropped even the smallest amount of weight. On the other hand, many <a href=#>stars who’ve lost weight have also had to deal with a harsh backlash</a>.</p><p>At the end of the day, it seems very clear that unless female stars forever fit an unreasonable body ideal, they will continuously be judged.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amazingly enough, however, even when a female star falls into that category, they too often are judged. In some cases, those stars are critiqued for their makeup or fashion choices and in others, they are simply called egotistical based on nothing.</p><p>There truly is no winning.</p><h2></h2><h2 id=how-chelsea-houska-lost-the-weight-and-the-dark-truth-it-reveals>How Chelsea Houska Lost The Weight And The Dark Truth It Reveals</h2><p>When Teen Mom 2 premiered in 2011, fans of the franchise were introduced to Jenelle Eason, Kailyn Lowry, and Leah Messer.</p><p>Just like her co-stars who were there from the start, the woman who now goes by Chelsea DeBoer played a key role in Teen Mom 2’s success. Then known by her maiden name Houska, it didn’t take long for viewers to care about Chelsea.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Fans Are Talking About 'Teen Mom' Star Chelsea Deboer's New House</a></span></p><p>From the first season of Teen Mom 2, Chelsea DeBoer remained a major part of the show until she left the series following the first half of the tenth season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>uring most of her television appearances over the years, DeBoer always looked a certain way. As a result, when DeBoers went through a dramatic weight change, there was a lot of interest in how she slimmed down so much.</p><p>Of course, unless you spend every minute of someone else’s waking life with them, there is no way to know for sure what they do daily. As a result, it is impossible to report every detail about how DeBoer dropped so much weight.</p><p>However, since DeBoer is used to cameras following her, it likely won’t surprise anyone that she has been open about how she transformed her body.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2020, Chelsea DeBoer revealed that she was working with Profile, a company that pledges that it is effective at helping people lose weight. According to a blog published on the company’s website, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DeBoer swears by her experience with Profile</a> and would suggest them to anyone who also wants to transform their bodies.</p><p>“I’m definitely ride-or-die Profile. If anyone asks me, I always say, ‘You have to try Profile.’ It’s the one thing that really worked for me and has actually lasted.” As for what Profile does for its client, the company offers services like personal healthy eating plans, coaches, and pre-packaged food options among others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on Chelsea DeBoer’s most recent Instagram post as of this writing, she certainly seems to have been able to keep the weight off as she claimed. Considering that is a massive struggle for most people with weight issues, that is a wonderful thing. However, there is a sad side to DeBoer working with Profile.</p><p>In the modern world, a lot of people have weight issues because it often is a lot cheaper and easier to consume food that is unhealthy. While Profile offers an alternative option in terms of having food on hand that is easy to eat and healthy for you, becoming one of the company’s customers is costly. According to Profile’s website, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the price of using their service is at least 21.32 USD daily</a> as of the time of this writing.</p><p>At that price, becoming a Profile customer is out of reach for a lot of people, whether or not the company is worth every penny it charges. Of course, people can lose weight without Profile’s help but it is sad that finances hold some people back from a service that could play a key role in them becoming healthier.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoZ2cqLKieceorKyjkWLEprXGoatmpJ%2BowG6%2FwpqlnZmcYrWww4ysn55llJ6xbrXTaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lil-kim-brings-out-sukihana-one-music-fest-1234807327.html><span>←</span><span>Lil Kim Brings Out Sukihana At ONE Music Fest: This Means So Much</span></a>
