Grew up damn near in the same neighborhood, but it’s always been there, it hasn’t been always publicized, but that’s basically family.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">If you’re wondering why DeMar was explicitly selected for the music video, it was due to Lamar’s bars that reference the athlete. The second verse of “Not Like Us” draws a clear line in the sand, with K. Dot reclaiming and protecting Compton royalty—specifically ones who may have crossed paths with Drizzy. “I’m glad DeRoz’ came home, y’all didn’t deserve him neither,” Lamar rapped. “From Alondra down to Central, ni**a better not speak on Serena.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>DeMar DeRozan speaks on being in Kendrick Lamar’s 'Not Like Us' music video ??</p><p>“I love Drake, but Kendrick damn near family.” <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/8vHTr76J0k</a></p>— NFR Podcast (@nfr_podcast) <a href=# rel=nofollow>July 10, 2024</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# id=auto-tag_serena-williams data-tag=serena-williams>Serena Williams</a> was name-dropped due to <a href=#>Drake’s past relationship</a> with the Compton tennis player, with the Canadian artist dissing her husband on “Middle of the Ocean.” Drake called her husband, Alexis Ohanian, “a groupie,” and threatened to pull up on him with his crew. Williams has since referred to “Not Like Us” as the <a href=#>“hit of the summer.”</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As for DeMar, the player used to be a part of the Toronto Raptors, the team that Drizzy loves and has business ties to. DeRozan would spend nine seasons with the Raptors before being traded to the San Antonio Spurs in 2018 for Kawhi Leonard and then the Chicago Bulls in 2021. However, the former USC star returned home to California, as he was recently traded from Chi-Town to Sactown.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">DeRozan previously made his Compton allegiance felt, appearing at Kendrick Lamar’s <a href=#>“The Pop Out” in June</a>.
