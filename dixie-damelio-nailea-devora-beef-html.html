Devora touched Beck’s head to ensure the filter could read Beck.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>It all seemed like harmless fun, but the internet soon started accusing Devora of trying to steal D’Amelio’s boyfriend. After that, Devora went on a TikTok rant, seemingly calling out the ‘Be Happy’ singer.&nbsp;</p><p>“This girl who thought I wanted her man because I breathed near him. I was breathing, and he was six feet away from me. While I was breathing. And she swore I wanted her man,” said Devora.&nbsp;She also clarified she had no intention of stealing Beck and commented that she had been in a relationship for almost a year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Dixie D’Amelio Says the Beef Was One-Sided</h2><p>During her appearance on the&nbsp;BFFs&nbsp;podcast, D’Amelio clarified she had no ill feelings toward Devora and that the beef was one-sided.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Dixie D'Amelio talks about her beef with Nailea Devora on BFFs</strong>.

It was a weird situation because I have never dealt with something that was brought to the internet. I wasn’t even mad about anything,” said D’Amelio.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyZrbamecOapJ6kmaR6r63IpZyaZZSaw7C%2BwGaZnp2WY7W1ucs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anna-love-beador.html><span>←</span><span>Anna Love Beador (Lesley Cooks Daughter) Wiki, Bio, Age, Parents</span></a>
