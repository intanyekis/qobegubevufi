However, the industry is still recovering from the loss faced by the box office. Last year's box office saw more of the younger audience with big-budget movies like Marvel's <i>No Way Home</i> and <i>Shang-Chi and the Legend Of The Ten Rings</i>. Marvel movies from Sony and Disney held the top four positions. Adult dramas for older audiences vastly underperformed or flopped. The industry is expected to continue the path of recovery in 2022. There are a lot of<a href=#> potential blockbusters in the making</a>. The rise in covid cases in the US led to a delay in significant projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Hollywood box office saw a decline in the older audience for 2021. Movies that appealed to younger audiences performed well considering the restrictions due to the pandemic. Although one cannot say that everything is back to the way it was before, the Hollywood box office seems to be recovering fast from the problems it faced with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h2 id=spider-man-no-way-home>Spider-Man: No Way Home</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a> says that <i>Spider-Man No Way Home</i> from Sony Productions is the highest-grossing film for 2021. The movie collected $613.6 million at the domestic box office and $1.37 billion globally. It stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker or Spider-Man along with Zendaya as his girlfriend MJ and Jacob Batalon as Ned, his Best Friend. Directed by Jon Watts, the film was a great success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 8 Highest-Grossing Mila Kunis Movies, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-ten-ring>Shang-Chi And The Legend Of Ten Ring</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Numbers</a> reports that <i>Shang-Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings </i>had the second-highest collection at the box office in 2021.

Justin Lin directed the film, starred by Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, John Cena, Ludacris, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, and Charlize Theron.

It was a PG-13 movie that served as prologue and epilogue to the original film.</p><p>Overall, the US box office had a pretty good run in 2021 compared to 2020, when all the movie theaters were shut down due to the outbreak of the 2020 pandemic. Although not back to its full glory before the pandemic, one could say that the box office is recovering from the restrictions at a steady pace. It is noted that the films that saw success at the box office in 2021 appealed to the younger audience rather than the older audience. The adult dramas that caught the attention of the older crowd either failed or did not reach the expected mark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Remembering Mark Lanegan: These Are The Singer's Highest-Grossing Songs</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Box Office Mojo</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paste Magazine</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Numbers</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSxsLnErKuim12XvLl5zp%2BdopuVYsGpsYxxZKGhl52ytMCMoKmoq6Oeu6h5zKitop2jYryneZFpaWpn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./youtube-star.html><span>←</span><span> Tyler Ashton Zaryki</span></a>
