Donald was introduced to Melania, <a href=#>who is 24 years his junior</a>, at a New York Fashion Week party in Manhattan.</p><p>“He wanted my number, but he was with a date, so, of course I didn’t give it to him,” the businesswoman <a href=#>revealed of their first meeting</a> during a January 2016 interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Harper’s Bazaar</a>. “I said, ‘I am not giving you my number; you give me yours, and I will call you.’”</p><p>Melania dialed her future husband a few days later and said she was “struck by his energy” and “amazing sense of vitality.” At the time, the real estate mogul was recently separated from ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Marla Maples</strong></a>, with whom he shares daughter <a href=#><strong>Tiffany Trump</strong></a>, born in 1993.</p><p>The pair began dating soon after they met and in April 2004, Donald popped the question <a href=#>at the Met Gala</a>. “It was a great surprise. We are very happy together,” Melania told the <a href=# rel=noopener>New York Post</a> at the time.</p><p>The <a href=#>lovebirds tied the knot</a> the following January at the Apprentice alum’s <a href=#>Mar-a-Lago resort</a>. Melania described the nuptials as “fantastic” during a May 2005 joint appearance with Donald on Larry King Live. When asked whether she’d been nervous on her wedding day, Melania told host <a href=#>Larry King</a>: “Not at all. … We know what kind of relationship we have. I don’t think I should be scared of anything.”</p><p>One year after exchanging vows, the duo welcomed <a href=#>their son, Baron</a>, in March 2006. Donald is also father of sons <a href=#><strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Eric Trump</strong></a> and daughter<a href=#><strong> Ivanka Trump</strong></a>&nbsp;with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Ivana Trump</strong></a>.</p><p>Melania stood by her husband’s side throughout the many controversies he faced throughout <a href=#>his 2016 presidential campaign</a>, his four years as Commander in Chief from 2017 to 2021 and further investigations into his conduct after he left the White House.</p><p>Despite her loyalty, <a href=#>the former first lady</a> has said that she doesn’t always see eye to eye with the controversial politician.</p><p>“I <a href=#>don’t always agree [with] what he thinks</a>, and I tell him that. I give him my honest opinion and honest advice,” she said while talking to reporters in Egypt during her October 2018 solo trip to Africa.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Melania emphasized that she had her “own voice and my own opinions and it’s very important for me that I express what I feel.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look at Donald and Melania’s relationship over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksbC6wKWbZqyiqrqxecCnm2allaGur7XAZqurrZ2lwG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mq6KllaG2r7GO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tony-hawk.html><span>←</span><span>Career &amp;amp; Net Worth [2023 Update]- Players Bio</span></a>
