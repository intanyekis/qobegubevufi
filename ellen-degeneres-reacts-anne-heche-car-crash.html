The former talk show host, who dated the actress from 1997 until 2000, responded to questions as she was out in Santa Barbara, California, with a friend on Monday, August 8. When asked about how her former girlfriend was doing, Ellen responded only briefly. “We are not in touch with each other, so I would not know,” she said, per the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a>. “I don’t want anyone to be hurt.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Ellen’s comment about Anne comes after the Men in Trees star made headlines for crashing her blue Mini Cooper first into an apartment building and then into a house, causing the latter and her vehicle to go up in flames, in the Mar Vista area of Los Angeles, CA. She was reportedly inside the car for around 30 minutes before firefighters were able to remove her and send her to the hospital with reported severe burns on her body.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Like Ellen, some of Anne’s other exes also spoke out publicly after hearing the terrifying news, including<strong> James Tupper</strong>, whom she dated from 2006 until 2018, and<strong> Thomas Jane</strong>, whom she dated in 2019. James took to Instagram to share a photo of Anne and their 13-year-old <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>son <strong>Atlas</strong></a> along with a caption. “Thoughts and prayers for this lovely woman, actress and mother tonight anneheche 💔 we love you,” it read.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Ellen-DeGeneres-Reacts-To-Ex-Anne-Heche-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Thomas <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spoke to Daily Mail</a> about the incident and gave an update on Anne’s condition as well. He called her “one of the true talents of her generation” and said that he offers his “thoughts and prayers.” He also revealed that she’s “expected to pull through” but remains intubated in the hospital since she’s suffering from burns.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The cause of Anne’s crash has yet to be determined but it’s believed she may <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>have been drinking alcohol</a> after a bottle of what looked like liquor was next to her in her vehicle, in a photo taken some time in between both collisions. A rep for Anne told us that she was “intubated and in a coma” following the accident. “Her family and friends ask for your thoughts and prayers and to respect her privacy during this difficult time,” the spokesperson said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e49yZp6knJq7brDEoJynnaKawG6%2BxJqaratdlruvsYyhnJyglWKwor6MnKmaq5hk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charissa-thompson.html><span>←</span><span>Charissa Thompson: Age, Husband and What College Did She Go to?</span></a>
