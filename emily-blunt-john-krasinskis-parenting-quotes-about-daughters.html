I’ve got one of those huge C-shaped ones. My husband calls it Gary.”</p><p class=p1>Blunt and the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Office</a>&nbsp;</i>alum — <a href=#>who wed in 2010</a> — went on to welcome daughters <a href=#>Hazel</a> and <a href=#>Violet</a> in February 2014 and June 2016, respectively.</p><p class=p1>“Their careers may be busy, but they have a great family life,”&nbsp;<a href=#>a source exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in December 2018</a>. “Most of the time, they’re just normal parents taking their kids to birthday parties and playdates. On the weekend they’re all out having brunch and playing at the park.”</p><p class=p1>While the England native and Krasinski <a href=#>love doting on their little ones</a>, Hazel and Violet are not as keen to understand their parents’ careers.</p><p class=p1>“They are usually disinterested in seeing me on screen, but they’re really into&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Jungle Cruise</i></a>,” Blunt quipped during <a href=#>a July 2021 appearance on&nbsp;<i>Live With Kelly and Ryan</i></a>, referring to her Disney film with<a href=#> <strong>Dwayne Johnson</strong></a>. “They love the jaguar, they love DJ, they love the dynamic, they love the whole world. It makes me so happy!”</p><p class=p1>While the&nbsp;<i>Mary Poppins Returns&nbsp;</i>star is <a href=#>happy to show off her acting achievements</a> to her daughters, she’s less pleased about their American accents.</p><p class=p1>“Hazel had my accent for a really long time and would say things like ‘water,’ which I was really proud of,” Blunt said during an October 2016 interview on&nbsp;<a href=#><i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i></a>, before noting that “the other day” she had switched her dictation. “I was like, ‘No!’”</p><p class=p1>Years later, their girls <a href=#>had adapted Blunt’s posh phrasing</a> after the family moved across the pond.</p><p class=p1>“They’ve actually been in a proper school with school uniforms,” the&nbsp;<i>Wild Mountain Thyme&nbsp;</i>actress said on&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!&nbsp;</i></a>in December 2020. “Miraculously, they’re s<a href=#>ounding quite British</a>, which I’m completely over the moon about.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>She added: “[Violet] sent me a video, well she didn’t actually send it but someone sent it, of her singing ‘Jingle Bells,’ and she goes, ‘Jingle ol’ da waye!’ Almost like a Cockney.
