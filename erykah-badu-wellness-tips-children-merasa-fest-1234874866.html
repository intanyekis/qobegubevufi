It’s been a journey. My oldest child is 27 now, so, for the past 27 years I’ve been their caregiver, their doctor, their nutritionist, their nurse,” she began. “My youngest is 15, so I hope I’ve instilled my lifestyle and the understanding of wellness into them. And I hope they get to use it in the world.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Since they were young, they had to do what I did. Then when they were all around sixth grade, I gave them the choice to do whatever they wanted to do, and they could trade in my rules for my school,” she further explained. “So, if they didn’t want to follow my rules, they still had to come to my school though, where I’d teach them still about these things. They had a choice.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">For Badu, <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234729611>wellness isn’t just a trendy word</a> or something you wake up and decide to do — it’s a way of life. It’s all about “picking up what you also put down.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Wellness is demonstrating more than anything,” she continued. “I wanted them to see me be honest. I wanted them to see me go through my lows and highs. I think that’s wellness — without making them responsible for it. I wanted them to share in my joys, and my other births as I had more babies and brought in more members of the family.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I think everything that they saw was part of me instilling wellness, good and bad. Especially because we were communicating.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Potato-Head-Wellness1.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This year Merasa will deliver a program that features a blend of traditional and innovative practices.
