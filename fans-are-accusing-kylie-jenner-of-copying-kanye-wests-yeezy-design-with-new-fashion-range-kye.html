A line of which Johnson alleges Jenner duped with Kye.</p><p>"We emailed Kylie and all her team @products.ltd concept and language and a line sheet 6 MONTHS AGO," Johnson wrote via Instagram. "INTERESTING CONCEPT KYLIE…INTERESTING. Thanks for the co-sign."</p><p>The post went on to say, "While I stare [at] my student debt. Worked my ass off for this. Like so many other working-class kids who bust their ass for expertise, they weren’t born into to realize their ideas."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kylie-jenner-finally-changes-her-son-s-name-almost-2-years-later-as-she-struggles-to-co-parent-with-travis-scott-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kylie Jenner Says Co-Parenting With Travis Scott Is Tough As He Faces Billions In Astroworld Lawsuits</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Their co-parenting relationship is also being affected by Kylie's new romance with Timothee Chalamet.</span><p>Johnson concluded saying, "I know who my supporters are in and outside of fashion.

With 12 different items to choose from, in sizes XXS to 4X, fans were thrilled to get their orders in before their sizes sold out. Each piece was priced at under $200.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans had an idea of what they were going to see on launch day, given that Jenner and her friends, including <a href=#>Hailey Bieber</a>, had been teasing the line via Instagram in the days before the launch.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kylie-jenner-wants-to-buy-back-600-million-stake-in-kylie-cosmetics-from-coty-inc-after-she-gets-sued-over-sale.jpeg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kylie Jenner’s Social Following Plummets By 1 Million After Sharing Controversial Pro-Israel Post</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Kylie's net worth is likely to be affected as she's experienced a wave of backlash, despite quickly deleting the IG pot.</span><p>Jenner has yet to comment on the accusations from Johnson or respond to the comments fans have made about her puffer jackets looking like West's former designs.
