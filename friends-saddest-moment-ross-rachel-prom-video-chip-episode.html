The series conquered the 90s and ushered in the 2000s in style. While doing so, it made the network millions while turning its leads into household names.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shows like Friends do not come around very often, and when they do, fans make sure to savor every single moment of it. These shows have such an amazing way of connecting with their massive audience, and one of the ways it does so is by being relatable while still maintaining the wonderful element of being a work of fiction.</p><p>Because Friends has been dissected so many times by fans and critics alike, it goes without saying that people have long talked about and ranked the best and worst moments from the show's storied run on NBC.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Courteney Cox Proves She's The Best 'Friend' By Plugging Jennifer Aniston's Hair Products</a></span></p><h2 id=it-has-many-hilarious-moments>It Has Many Hilarious Moments</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Friends is the perfect example of a show that has too many amazing moments to count, and whenever fans are watching the show, they get the chance to experience those amazing moments all over again while also getting the chance to appreciate other moments that might have passed them by initially.</p><p>Many fans and even websites have tried ranking these hilarious moments, and there are a number of standouts that are consistently highlighted.</p><p>Over at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranker</a>, they did a write-up on the show's funniest moment.</p><p>"During a New York City-wide blackout, Ross tries to confess his feelings to Rachel on Monica's balcony when an adorable, fuzzy cat jumps onto his shoulder, attacking him out of the hatred in his tiny little heart.

To be honest, there are a number of moments to choose from, and this question has been posed many times through the years. However, when combing through fans' opinions, there is one particular scene that keeps popping up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In season two, the show aired "The One with the Prom Video," which featured a flashback of some of our favorite characters gearing up for prom. During the video, Ross has his heart shattered when he goes to ask Rachel to prom. This is the moment that many fans have selected as the saddest in the show's history.</p><p>As on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> user wrote, "For me, it's the scene where the group watches Monica and Rachel get ready for prom, and Ross get ready to take Rachel to prom only for Chip to show up, because I 100% understand the pain Ross felt then, getting yourself all prepped and ready for something you've dreamed of happening for ages, only for it to all come horrifically crashing down."</p><p>One user specifically talked about the scene's acting, writing, "Man, Schwimmer really knows how to put on a pity-inducing expression. I felt so touched by his gesture that I actually teared up. (But I also think that it had to do with me having just broken up with my then-boyfriend)."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another user in a separate thread wrote, "The One with the Prom Video, and Ross is about to ask Rachel to prom but she leaves.
