"He picked a fight with me. He started it for no reason at all. He put out this thing saying, 'George Clooney, Harrison Ford, and Robert De Niro are sellouts'," said George.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/George-Clooney-Russell-Crowe.jpg><p>"And I put out a statement saying, 'He's probably right. And I'm glad he told us, 'cause Bob and Harrison and I were also thinking about starting a band, which would also fall under the heading of bad use of celebrity," he joked.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These comments didn't sit right with Russell and he decided to take the argument one step further. George also tried to reduce the tension by sending him a note. "That's when he really went off on me. 'Who the f**k does this guy think he is? He's a Frank Sinatra wannabe.' He really went after me. And so I sent him a note going, 'Dude, the only people who succeed when two famous people are fighting is People magazine.

Commenting on the gesture, Russell said, "He sends me a disc of his music and a thing of his poetry. I think he said, 'I was all misquoted,' and I was like, 'Yeah, yeah. Whatever.' I did take it with me to the BAFTAs, but I didn't win. I might have used it if I had won.

Although it's been almost 24 years since its release, fans still love the movie and were recently left surprised by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumor of a possible return</a> of Russell Crowe as Maximus in a sequel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Russell-Crowe-Gladiator.jpg><p>The actor, 59, was recently spotted in Malta, near the sets of 'Gladiator 2'. This is what ignited the speculations that Russell might reprise his role. However, the actor promptly shot down the rumors. Talking about his presence near the sets, he said, "I looked across to Fort Ricasoli, and the Colosseum’s been built there again, just like it was in 1999. I tell you, man, it was like a time warp — for a couple of seconds there, I was like, ‘What year is this?
