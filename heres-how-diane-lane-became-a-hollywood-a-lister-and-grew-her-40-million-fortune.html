And even today at 57, the mention of her name is still synonymous with greatness in the acting world. Born in <a href=#>New York City</a> on January 22, 1965, she seemed destined for some form of entertainment being that her mother, Colleen Farrington, was a nightclub singer and her father, Burton Lane, was a Manhattan acting drama coach taxi driver, and humanities teacher. Her parents' professions seemed to have given her the balance she would need to later share the screen with <a href=#>acting giants like Tom Cruise</a>, Patrick Swayze, and the ever-controversial Nicolas Cage.&nbsp;Let's take a closer look at how she amassed her $40 million net worth as an actress, according to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Celebrity Net Worth.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 id=a-rising-starlet>A Rising Starlet</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Diane Lane began her unforgettable career at the age of 6 while she was still under the custody of her father. She began acting at the La Mama Experimental Theatre Club and by 12 years old she landed a role beside <a href=#>Hollywood's diva Meryl Streep</a> and Irene Worth in The Cherry Orchard. Due to her busy acting schedule, her grades in school began to suffer. But she was smart enough not to miss her film debut opposite Laurence Olivier in the 1979 romantic comedy, A Little Romance, which got her featured on the cover of Time Magazine at just 13 years old as one of Hollywood's "Whiz Kids."</p><p>This only helped to catapult her career, and she soon began landing solid roles, starting with Lamont Johnson's western films, Little Britches and Cattle Annie, the latter of which was her debut role as a lead actress.&nbsp;She then starred in the 1982 comedy-drama, Six Pack, with <a href=#>musician Kenny Rogers</a> and Anthony Michael Hall which grossed over $20 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Around this time, Lane faced personal drama in her life, declaring her independence from her father's custody at age 15, and moved to Los Angeles to further her acting career. However, she returned to New York to live with a family friend after realizing the gravity of her decision.&nbsp;There, she continued the wave of success, landing her breakthrough roles in<a href=#> Francis Ford Coppola's</a> The Outsiders and Rumble Fish, starring rising acting legends such as Matt Dillon, Micky Rourke, Tom Cruise, and Dennis Hopper. The films grossed $33.7 million and $2.5 million respectively.</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Director's Cut: The 8 Highest-Grossing Films Directed By Richard Attenborough</a></strong></span></p><h2 id=entering-the-big-leagues>Entering The Big Leagues</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1984, she starred in the rock musical film, Streets of Fire opposite Willem Dafoe and Rick Moranis as well as The Cotton Club, alongside Richard Gere, Nicolas Cage, and Laurence Fishburne which were meant to skyrocket her to stardom. However, they both flopped at the box office, causing Lane to take a three-year hiatus from acting which she used to reconnect with her mother who she hadn't seen for some years.</p><p>Returning to the film industry in the late 1980s, she made waves on the Western adventure<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> TV miniseries Lonesome Dove</a>, for which she was nominated for an Emmy Award. She would then appear in Richard Attenborough's 1992 biopic, Chaplin, which grossed $9.5 million globally. In the following years, she co-starred with Robin Williams in the 1996 comedy/drama, Jack, which grossed $58.6 million as well as <a href=#>Judge Dredd starring Sylvester Stallone</a> which did $113.5 million at the box office. She ended the decade with the 1999 drama film, A Walk on the Moon, starring Viggo Mortensen, earning herself an Independent Spirit nomination for Best Female Lead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To kick off the new millennium, Diane played the love interest of <a href=#>actor/entrepreneur Mark Wahlberg</a> in The Perfect Storm, grossing $328.7 million at the box office. Subsequently, in 2002 she starred in the erotic thriller Unfaithful, alongside Richard Gere and Olivier Martinez, which grossed close to $120 million. The heavily sexualized scenes led her to receive nominations for the Best Actress Academy Award and Golden Globe. The following year in 2003, she shared the screen with Sandra Oh in Under The Tuscan Sun which amassed $58.9 million. She later landed lead roles in Must Love Dogs (2005), a romantic comedy starring <a href=#>A-list actor John Cusack</a> which raked in $58.4 million at the box office. She went on to star in Hollywoodland with Adrien Brody and Ben Affleck, earning $16.8 million globally.</p><h2 id=from-then-til-now>From Then 'Til Now</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From 2005 onwards, she starred in a number of hit movies, including Jumper (2008) alongside Hayden Christensen and Samuel L. Jackson, grossing $225.1 million. Her lead role in the psychological thriller, Untraceable (2008), grossed $53 million, and the same year starred in the Killshot thriller opposite Thomas Jane and Mickey Rourke. The films that followed include Disney's Secretariat, starring John Malkovich and <a href=#>Star Trek actor James Cromwell</a>, Man of Steel (2013) which grossed $668 million, Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice, grossing $873.6 million, Justice League (2017), earning $657.9 million, Paris Can Wait (2016), and the 2015 biographical drama, Trumbo, starring Bryan Cranston and Helen Mirren.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, she has continued to appear in both film and television, including the Amazon original miniseries The Romanoffs as well as the Netflix hit series, House of Cards. Her most recent film appearances include 2019's Serenity, where she played one of <a href=#>Matthew McConaughey's</a> love interests, which sadly bombed at the box office. Her latest film in 2020 was named Let Him Go, where she co-starred with Kevin Costner and grossed $11.6 million at the box office.</p><p>With over 45 years of professional acting, Diane Lane has been able to secure herself a healthy net worth. Apart from her sumptuous earnings, she has also been an activist for Oceana, which is dedicated to protecting the world's oceans and marine life.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> According to Born Rich</a>, she has also given to Heifer International, which is a charitable organization that has been committed to protecting the environment while training countries to end hunger by being self-sufficient.</p><p><span class=next-single><strong>READ NEXT: <a href=#>From 'The Goonie' To 'Avengers': 10 Highest-Grossing Josh Brolin Movies</a></strong></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Born Rich</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thoughts From The Mountain Top</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1pr7ErGShp6disaqtzZ5kpZmemnqjscKapJ5lkWK1sLjLsq6op5Rirm64yKyrnqpdlrulecarnLBlmJq%2FboCPZqSipJyevK95xaipra2emnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./russia-accuses-wagner-chief-urging-armed-rebellion.html><span>←</span><span>Charges against Wagner chief will be dropped; Prigozhin headed to Belarus WSOC TV</span></a>
