India Today's Tanushree Roy gave the film a 3/5 rating and wrote: "Heropanti 2, starring Tiger Shroff, Tara Sutaria, and Nawazuddin Siddiqui, is a paisa vasool entertainment. However, it has problems of its own ". "Despite rich production value and amazing stunts by Tiger Shroff, HEROPANTI 2 suffers from a terrible plot," commented Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama, who gave the film a 3/5 grade. The Times of India's Archika Khurana awarded the film a 2.5/5 rating, writing, "Heropanti 2 provides a little bit of everything—action, drama, music, romance, and exotic settings." "Tiger Shroff doesn't even bother to act in this one," stated a Pinkvilla reviewer, giving the film a 1.5/5 grade. It lacks the heroism, thrill, romance, emotion, humor, and action that a "true commercial picture" should have. Scroll.in's Nandini Ramnath awarded the film a 1/5 rating. The Indian Express' Shubhra Gupta gave the film a 1/5 rating, writing, "This film has no storyline." When Tiger Shroff isn't mowing down hordes of villains, it's simply a succession of set-pieces with him prancing, romancing, and dancing." NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee gave the film a 1/5 rating and wrote: "This is a mashup of a film constructed on a mountain of nonsense that becomes larger by the minute. Neither Tiger nor Nawazuddin will be able to save it ".. "They say certain movies leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth, Heropanti 2 leaves blisters & sores," commented Umesh Punwani of Koimoi, who gave the film a 0.5/5 rating.</p><p><strong>Heropanti 2 &nbsp;Actor(Hero):&nbsp;</strong>Tiger Shroff</p><p><img alt="Heropanti 2 movie Wiki" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/savedaughters.com/public/ckimages/ck_1651664633.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Heropanti 2&nbsp; Actress(Heroin)</strong>Tara Sutaria</p><p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/savedaughters.com/public/ckimages/ck_1651664655.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Heropanti 2&nbsp; Actor(Villain)</strong> Nawazuddin Siddiqui</p><p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/savedaughters.com/public/ckimages/ck_1651664689.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Heropanti 2 Director:&nbsp;</strong>Ahmed Khan</p><p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/savedaughters.com/public/ckimages/ck_1651664704.webp style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Heropanti 2 Producer:&nbsp;</strong>Sajid Nadiadwala</p><p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/savedaughters.com/public/ckimages/ck_1651664718.webp style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Heropanti 2 Story</strong>&nbsp;– Rajat Arora</p><p><strong>Genre:&nbsp;</strong>Action/Drama</p><p><strong>Heropanti 2 Music</strong>&nbsp;– A R Rahman</p><p><strong>Heropanti 2 Lyrics</strong>&nbsp;– Mahboob</p><p><strong>Heropanti 2 Production Company:&nbsp;</strong>Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment</p><p><strong>Heropanti 2 Release Date: 29 April 2022</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirkauypa3UoJ%2BtnaKoe6S7zGiZpaeXZLWmvs6pmKesmWJ%2FbsPIpKA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brandy-pregnancy-rumor-513195.html><span>←</span><span>Brandy Might Have Just Announced Her Pregnancy</span></a>
