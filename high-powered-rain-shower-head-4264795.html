This $30 high-powered rain shower head will make you feel like you're unwinding under a soul-cleansing waterfall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rain-shower-head-ftr.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-1><span id=more-4264795></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-2>If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, we may receive an affiliate commission.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Quarantine rules are tightening up and working from home can take a toll. Now, imagine if you could end your day with a shower so good, it washes away all the stresses of the world (even if it’s just for five minutes). Here’s a life hack that could drastically improve your bedtime (or morning) routine: a <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>high-powered rain shower head from SparkPod</a></strong>, which is only $30 on Amazon!</p><p style=text-align:left><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Get the high-powered rain shower head here for $30!</a></strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>So, what separates this shower head from your standard one at the Home Depot? First of all, pressure: this won’t produce a wimpy downpour of water onto your body, which provides little respite. This SparkPod shower head is equipped with 90 silicone jets to engulf you in a waterfall of steamy water. You can easily position wherever you want the shower head to shoot out water, too, since it’s built with a brass swivel ball joint. You won’t have to worry about the buildup of gunk transferring from the shower head to your body, either, since the jets are covered with rubber nozzles that you can easily wipe. Bye-bye yucky limescale!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-8.03.23-PM.png alt="high powered rain shower head" width=525 height=515 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Not only does this shower head feel good, but it also looks good! It’s chrome plated and thus will enhance that “industrial washroom” look that all the most popular Pinterest boards for interior design seem to have. Inside the shower head is ABS plastic to withstand the daily showers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-8.04.34-PM.png alt="high powered rain shower head" width=525 height=515 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>And we get it, replacing a shower head just sounds like another chore to add to our seemingly never-ending list of tasks we have to attend to that day. But the replacement is seriously easy with this shower head. First off, NO TOOLS are required. Second of all — and this is the best part — this is a universal shower head, meaning it can connect to any standard shower arm (SparkPod says this should only take five minutes to do). To make the installation process even easier, SparkPod will send you free teflon tape and an additional water filter to aid with fitting on your new shower head.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>While the sound of 90 jets shooting out of water sound like a death kiss to your water bill, it’s actually anything but! The outflow on this high-powered rain shower head maxes out at 1.8 gallons per minute (GPM) — for context, U.S. government standards <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mandate</a> that your shower head can only use up to 2.5 gpm of water. So, it’s possible to have that long shower experience you deserve without racking up your water and heater bills.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>There are beauty benefits, too, with having a shower head that delivers even more hot waters to your pores. Steam opens up the pores, which in turn makes it easier for you to clean out the dirt that tends to build up inside them throughout the day.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Now, let’s turn to the Amazon reviews because there’s a lot of them: more than 2,000 total! This shower head has a near-perfect average rating — 4.6 out of 5 stars — and one customer regarded it as an “invigorating treat at the start of, and at the end of any day,” while another reviewer loved that you’re given the choice to put in the “flow restriction piece.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGiqoaegZLWqs8dmp6ivlaeypXnRmqCnZaOdvLix0WafnpmUYoFzgpNwcG5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elvis-duran.html><span>←</span><span>Elvis Duran</span></a>
