Amber Heard trial currently ongoing</a> in Fairfax, Virginia. Perhaps no name more high profile has been mentioned than that of tech entrepreneur <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, who dated Heard briefly following her divorce from Depp back in 2017. The richest man in the world reportedly made a large donation for Heard to a chosen charity which she had vowed to donate her divorce settlement to. Though their relationship was brief, Musk and Amber have both had quite a bit to say publicly about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Why Did Amber Heard And Elon Musk Break Up?">Why Did Amber Heard And Elon Musk Break Up?</a></span></p><p>So what are some of the things Elon has said about his ex-girlfriend Amber Heard?</p><h2 id=the-ex-couple-made-a-joint-statement-after-parting-ways><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Ex Couple Made A Joint Statement After Parting Ways</span></h2><p><a href=#>Amber and Elon called things quits eventually</a>, and announced the news in a joint statement given to People in August 2017:</p><p>"Having read recent articles about our relationship, we would like to speak for ourselves," read their statement. "The distance has been really tough on our relationship, because we haven't been able to see each other much.</p><p>"All relationships have their ups and downs, of course. People occasionally send out speculation, which has no basis in fact, without our knowledge, believing that that they have our best interests in mind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Sometimes, other agendas are at work. It can get a little weird...

I was really in love, and it hurt bad... Well, she broke up with me more than I broke up with her, I think."</p><p>It took several days before the split was made public, and Musk struggled to attend events and put on a show of contentment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I've been in severe emotional pain for the last few weeks," Musk said. "Severe. It took every ounce of will to be able to do the Model 3 event and not look like the most depressed guy around.</p><p>"For most of that day, I was morbid. And then I had to psych myself up: drink a couple of Red Bulls, hang out with positive people and then, like, tell myself: 'I have all these people depending on me. All right, do it!'"</p><h2 id=musk-needs-romance-in-his-life><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Musk Needs Romance In His Life</span></h2><p>Musk added that he struggles to feel happy without romantic love in his life, saying: "If I'm not in love, if I'm not with a long-term companion, I cannot be happy..

Going to sleep alone kills me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=but-amber-heard-was-less-happy-to-discuss-the-split><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>But Amber Heard Was Less Happy To Discuss The Split</span></h2><p>Though Elon seemed happy to share his feelings with the world, Heard revealed less of her personal feelings, taking to Instagram in August 2017 to say: "Being in the public eye means having to explain yourself to so many people, so much of the time. In this case, I'd like to remain more quiet.</p><p>"Although we have broken up, Elon and I care deeply for one another and remain close.
