After the release of her song, Drivers License, led the singer to the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100, it was safe to say the song wasn't done exploding yet! While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the meaning behind the song</a> is still up in the air, the coin Olivia is making remains very clear! So, just how much did the star earn from her hit song?

The star first came to prominence over two years ago when she was cast in the role of Nini Salazar-Roberts in the Disney+ show, High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.&nbsp;Rodrigo had previously been part of the Disney family, as she had played Paige Olvera in&nbsp;Bizaardvark.&nbsp;During this time, it is estimated the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Olivia made on average $10,000 to $20,000 per episode</a> for both shows, says Cosmpolitan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While she managed to earn quite a bit as a Disney star, it is Olivia's success with her most recent song, Driver's License, that has skyrocketed her net worth! The song has been streamed nearly 300 million times on Spotify, amassed over 90 million views on YouTube, and has now spent 3 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, making the song a huge moneymaker! Luckily for Olivia, the release of her single has allowed her to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">amass a net worth of $500,000.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Olivia Rodrigo And Vanessa Hudgens Open Up About Issues With High School Musical</a></span></p><p>Considering Rodrigo has only been in the limelight since 2016, the star has done significantly well for herself in such a short span of time. The success of her song is truly only the beginning for Olivia, as Billboard anticipates her to be the next "big thing". While fans are loving the song, many are very curious as to who exactly Olivia is singing about. Well, many have come to the conclusion that the catchy tune was inspired after Rodrigo split from her fellow High School Musical co-star, Joshua Bassett.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There has been drama stirring about between Olivia, Joshua and singer, Sabrina Carpenter, who appear to have all <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">found themselves in a feud triangle</a>. While all of this remains speculative, it goes without saying that the singer is getting all the success she deserves. Fans continue to praise the hit single for bringing them back to a time everyone can relate to, proving just how great the power of music is, and just how rich you can become off of it!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Little Known Facts About HSM: The Musical: The Series' Joshua Bassett</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1ln6G2t7XAZqmonKKetLB5xJqpp2Wfm7Nuu8Vmm6uhppq%2FtHnLopqepqOafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eddie-ogamba-9p3dumds1i7yde73.html><span>←</span><span>Eddie Ogamba - College Football Kicker - News, Stats, Bio and more</span></a>
