His second studio album,&nbsp;“Wasteland, Baby!”&nbsp;released in March 2019 under British label Island Records, doesn’t stray from his Blues roots.</p><p dir=ltr>His integrity and unwillingness to give in to the musical trends have only widened his fanbase, which meant an increase in album and tour ticket sales. With his fantastic popularity and success, the 31-year-old Irish rocker boasts a net worth of millions.</p><p dir=ltr><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span id=div-gpt-ad-liverampup_com-medrectangle-4-0 class="ezoic-ad ezfound"></span>To think that it all began with the music video for&nbsp;Take Me To Church&nbsp;going viral is mind-boggling. The four-minute-long clip received notoriety for its pro-LGBTQIA+ messaging. Without reading much into the song’s lyrics, detractors quickly labeled Hozier a closeted gay.</p><p dir=ltr>Months later, he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">clarified</a> that the song is much about sex and humanity. He states that sex and humanity are tied together, and regardless of any sexual orientation, it is just natural, but the church says that it is doctrine and sinful. However, he also claims that the song is not an attack on faith.</p><p>“The song is about asserting yourself and reclaiming your humanity through an act of love… But it’s not an attack on faith… it’s an assertion of self, reclaiming humanity back for something that is the most natural and worthwhile…”</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Hozier_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family>Where was Hozier born?

In many ways, Hozier, now age 31 as of 2021, is living his father’s dream, who became paraplegic after a failed spine surgery in 1996.</p><h2><span id=Is_Hozier_Single_Relationship_Girlfriend>Is Hozier Single?

The rumored lovebirds initially fueled the dating gossip in the spring of 2017 after they got spotted enjoying a string of intimate dates.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span id=div-gpt-ad-liverampup_com-box-4-0 class="ezoic-ad ezfound"></span></p><p dir=ltr>But after the musician got spotted with a mystery brunette later that year, reports claimed that the relationship between the two was a done and dusted affair.
