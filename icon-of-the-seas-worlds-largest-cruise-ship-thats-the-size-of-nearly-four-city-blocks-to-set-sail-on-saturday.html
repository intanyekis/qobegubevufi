The world’s largest cruise ship is set to sail its maiden voyage.
Royal Caribbean’s Icon of the Seas, which at 1,200 feet long is the size of almost four city blocks, will leave from the Port of Miami on Saturday.
The massive ship with 20 decks, valued at $2 billion, can hold 7,600 passengers and 2,350 crew members.
It also boasts a 17,000-square-foot water park with six waterslides and seven pools, including the 40,000-gallon Royal Bay, which is the largest pool at sea and Absolute Zero, the largest ice skating rink at sea."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
