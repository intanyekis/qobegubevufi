So it's not surprising that her friend group consists of some of the most famous Gen Z personalities. Perhaps the one that stands out the most is Olivia Rodrigo, who is probably her best friend in the world, but she's close to lots of artists and public personalities.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Iris And Maude Apatow's Life As Adults, Revealed</a></span>This article will dive into Iris Apatow's closest celebrity friendships, what they share, and what these friends are famous for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=talia-ryder><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Talia Ryder</span></h2><p>Among the many famous friends Iris Apatow keeps is Talia Ryder, a young star that rose to stardom not too long ago, and has done many incredible things ever since. Her breakthrough role was as Hortensia in the Broadway cast of Matilda the Musical, and she recently starred as Skylar in the 2020 movie Never Rarely Sometimes Always. She will be starring in the upcoming film Hello, Goodbye, and Everything In Between, a movie based on Jennifer E. Smith's novel by the same name, that will come out in just a couple of months. Iris has posted several pictures with Talia, and they're obviously close. While it's not known how she and Iris met, Talia appeared in Olivia Rodrigo's music video for "Deja Vu", so they might have connected through the singer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=avani-gregg><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Avani Gregg</span></h2><p>Avani Gregg has only recently become famous, but despite being very young, she has managed to use her exposure and take control of her image to do whatever she wants to do with her platform. She first went viral in 2019 on a TikTok video where she did a Harley Quinn-style makeup session. She has since become a professional makeup artist and joined the LA-based collective for TikTok creators called The Hype House along with Charli D'Amelio. Iris has been seen many times with both Charli and Avani, along with Olivia, and the group seems to be close friends by now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=coco-arquette><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Coco Arquette</span></h2><p><a href=#>Young Coco Arquette grew up right in the spotlight</a> too, as the daughter of the Friends star Courteney Cox and actor/director/producer David Arquette. Coco has, however, proved her own talent many times. During quarantine, she and Courteney posted a few videos making music together, with the actress playing the piano and Coco singing.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Judd Apatow Has Been Up To Recently</a></span></p><p>Her skills blew everyone away, including Iris, who was beyond impressed by her "angel and best friend." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She commented on the post</a> saying that she was "so talented it hurts." These two are not only best friends, they're each other's biggest fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charli-d-amelio><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Charli D'Amelio</span></h2><p>Anyone that's on social media has, at some point or another, seen some Charli D'Amelio content. She's very young, but she's had a long career already. She began dancing when she was just three years old and competed for a decade before becoming a social media hit. She's since obtained multiple brand deals and ad campaigns that have raised her popularity even more. Nowadays, she's very close with Iris, and the two of them share the same group of friends.</p><h2 id=natalia-bryant><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Natalia Bryant</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is no denying that Natalia Bryant's life hasn't been easy these last couple of years. Losing her father, Kobe Bryant, in such a traumatic way and having it broadcasted all over the world must be one of the toughest things to go through.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Olivia Rodrigo Still Friends With Her Ex Ethan Wacker?</a></span></p><p>Luckily, though, she has a good friend in her corner. Iris and Natalia appear to be very close and have stated that they love each other on social media on more than one occasion. They've shared lots of experiences together, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including going to a few Harry Styles concerts</a>.</p><h2 id=olivia-rodrigo><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Olivia Rodrigo</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course we have to mention the bestie here, the one and only Olivia Rodrigo. The two of them go way back, apparently. Iris Apatow was a VIP guest at the SOUR release party, and the two of them constantly post about how much they love and support each other. One of the things Olivia shared that they love doing together is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">binge-watch sitcoms and shows from the early 2000s</a>, and there is one in particular that they really identify with.</p><p>"I think we’re Carrie and Samantha from Sex and the City," the singer said. "We are dramatic, fiercely loyal, and we both love going to brunch." Clearly, a friendship for the ages.</p><h2 id=the-bffs-tattoo><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The BFFs Tattoo</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And one day, Iris Apatow, Olivia Rodrigo, Charli D'Amelio, and Avani Gregg decided to make it official. In March 2022, the four of them made the ultimate commitment and swore to be best friends forever by getting matching tattoos on their fingers. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charli posted a TikTok</a> showing part of the process and the result, which means that half the world got to see it, and it's completely adorable to see how happy they are together and how sure they were of cementing their friendship, knowing for sure that it will last forever.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How Olivia Rodrigo And Taylor Swift Became Friends</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigq6GjYq6xrdOormaekaK8tr%2BMn6minZ6ZwG67y6Ktopldp7ylvsigpmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./summerland-cast-where-are-they-now.html><span>←</span><span>Summerland Cast: Where Are They Now?</span></a>
