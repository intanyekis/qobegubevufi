<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Is Steve Spitz Still Alone After Failing To Find A Girlfriend On Love On The Spectrum</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Back when<strong> <a href=#>Netflix</a></strong> first became a streaming service, there was no way to know how popular the company would become. As a result of how many people watch Netflix regularly, the streaming service has been able to change Hollywood and television in a lot of ways. On the television side of things, Netflix has proven that millions of people want to see diverse groups of people be centered in the entertainment business. One perfect example of that is even though some people <a href=#>questioned if Love on the Spectrum would be worth watching</a>, the show became a big hit with a lot of viewers.Able to <a href=#>battle a lot of people's misconceptions of autism</a>, Love on the Spectrum helped a lot of people to let go of the stereotypes they had about what it means to be on the spectrum. On top of that, it was wonderful to see so many people that have been ignored far too often in the past have the spotlight.While Love on the Spectrum fans know the show focused on several fantastic people, one of the show's stars appeared to be the most popular by far. Unfortunately for the fans who loved Steve Spitz so much, he didn't find love by the time the show's first season ended. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, has Steve found someone since then?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-are-the-stars-of-love-on-the-spectrum-us>Who Are The Stars Of Love On The Spectrum US?</h2><p>During the first season of the American version of Love on the Spectrum, the show introduced its devoted viewers to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">its incredible cast made up of extremely compelling people</a>. Like most successful reality shows, Love on the Spectrum had a passionate fan following many of whom had their own favorites.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/D0A28F21-6789-4D44-992C-7B1ADBE55C7A.jpeg><p>Unlike some of her co-stars, Love on the Spectrum's Abbey appeared on the show with her boyfriend David. An animal lover with a popular TikTok account, Abbey who was 23 when she was filmed for Love on the Spectrum's first season also runs a hat-making business.</p><p>A 32-year-old at the time of the first season's filming who is close to his sister he lives with, Subodh would love to find someone to share his life with and travel the world with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Love On The Spectrum': Is Abby Still With David?</a></span></p><p>Just like Subodh, Kaelynn has a roommate, her best friend Gracie. 24 years old when she was filmed for Love on the Spectrum's first season, Kaelynn is a behavioral therapist for autistic children who has experience going on bad dates.</p><p>Then there is James who was 24 years old when he was filmed for the first season of Love on the Spectrum. Bullied throughout his high school years, James has found friends as an adult, loves dressing up in Renaissance fairs, and has dated in the past. During his time on Love on the Spectrum, James focused on finding a more serious relationship.</p><h2 id=has-steve-spitz-from-love-on-the-spectrum-found-love-after-the-show>Has Steve Spitz From Love On The Spectrum Found Love After The Show?</h2><p>During Love on the Spectrum's six-episode first season, the show had a lot to do. After all, six episodes isn't a lot of time to introduce viewers to so many cast members and show some of the ups and downs in their lives as they navigate trying to find lasting love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/love-on-the-spectum-s-steve-spitz-with-his-arms-wide-open.jpg><p>Despite the fact that Love on the Spectrum's first season was so short, there was more than enough time for fans to know Steve Spitz enough to adore the man. By far the show's oldest cast member, there was something about who Steve seemed to be on the show and his voice that most viewers couldn't get enough of.</p><p>Only diagnosed with being neurodivergent a couple of years before filming began, that information clearly wasn't a shock for Steve. After all, Steve told Netflix's cameras that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he always understood he was different</a> from his peers.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Fans Are Saying About The US Version Of 'Love On The Spectrum'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Growing up, I always knew deep, deep, deep down that I didn’t really fit in. Inside of my brain, I knew something was different. I might be a little goofy, I might be a little bit weird, but you know what? The intentions are always good."</p><p>A 63-year-old man who lived in San Francisco, Steve was open about the fact that he'd been single his whole life. Despite spending all that time without being in a relationship and the fact that Steve was open about feeling lonely, he still managed to remain optimistic about the prospects of finding love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/steve-spitz-smiling-during-welcome-change-productions-interview.jpg><p>With the help of his assistant, Steve created an online dating profile for himself during the filming of Love on the Spectrum. In the end, Steve's profile wasn't successful in finding the lovable man in his sixties a mate when the cameras were still there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for Steve and any of his fans that were hoping he would find love after he finished filming the first season of Love on the Spectrum, there is no indication that he isn't single anymore.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Netflix Really Not Pay The Cast Of Love On The Spectrum?</a></span></p><p>The most recent report about Steve's love life appears to stem from mid-2022 and confirmed that he was single at that time.</p><p>In theory, there is a pretty good possibility that fans won't get any more updates about Steve's love life from this point going on. After all, Steve isn't on social media, and it is less likely that members of the media will reach out to interview him as time goes on if he isn't in the spotlight anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the bright side, it still is possible that fans will get further updates about Steve's love life in the future.</p><p>In September 2022, it was announced that Love on the Spectrum US would be returning for a second season. As of the time of this writing, there is no indication if any of Love on the Spectrum's stars from the first season will return, much less if Steve will be a part of the second season. That said, if the show's producers realize how popular Steve is, there is a decent chance he will be back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWjqbK3sYysp6KsqmKurbvNnmSanqSav26ywKKjoqaXYsGwecWipZ1lkWK0qr7Ln6minZ6ZerC6jKWmr51dpLtuwMeeZKyolZjBs8HMaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-ian-bohen-a-homosexual-girlfriend-relationship-timeline-explore-557611-html.html><span>←</span><span>Is Ian Bohen A Homosexual?
