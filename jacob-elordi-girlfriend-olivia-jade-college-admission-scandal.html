Keep reading to find out...</p><h2 id=who-is-jacob-elordi-currently-dating>Who Is Jacob Elordi Currently Dating?</h2><p>Jacob Elordi getting linked to different Hollywood celebrities is not new, as even <a href=#>Jacob and his long-time friend Zendaya were rumored to be in a romantic relationship</a> before Zendaya dated Marvel's Spider-Man actor, Tom Holland. Another failed relationship fans hoped for was with <a href=#>Elordi and his Euphoria co-star Sydney Sweeney</a>. However, to their fans' dismay, Sydney already has a non-showbiz boyfriend who makes it impossible for her and Jacob to have any relationship aside from being co-stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2021, fans thought Jacob was finally taking things seriously with his relationship with American model Kaia Gerber. They were surprised when the two quietly broke up in November for an unknown reason. However, Jacob quickly got back to the dating game when he started his current girlfriend, Youtube vlogger, and influencer Olivia Jade Giannulli, or Olivia Jade as she goes by on social media.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jacob Elordi Had One Rule Euphoria's Production Team Had To Follow</a></span></p><p>Only a month after breaking up with Kaia, pictures of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elordi having coffee with Olivia surfaced on the internet, which led fans to speculate about their possible romantic relationship.</a></p><p>In May 2022, Olivia Jade was spotted leaving Jacob's house wearing an oversized sweater and a bare face, which led the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">media to confirm that they were officially dating</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-olivia-jade-and-jacob-elordi-break-up>Did Olivia Jade And Jacob Elordi Break Up?</h2><p>It is unlikely that the couple broke up after only less than a year of dating. However, it would not be surprising if Olivia and Jacob would break up quietly, as a source tells Us Weekly that the two are keeping it casual.</p><p>While Jacob Elordi had his recent break-up with Kaia Gerber, Olivia Jade ended her rocky relationship with her ex-boyfriend and American singer-songwriter Jackson Guthy. Olivia and Jackson dated in 2019 but broke up in August 2021.</p><p>They were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumored to get back together again in October</a> after they were seen leaving a cannabis store together. However, after not confirming the actual status of their relationship, rumors between them died when Olivia was seen out with Jacob Elordi in December 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-olivia-jade>What Happened To Olivia Jade?</h2><p>Olivia Jade Giannulli is the youngest daughter of the legendary fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli and actress Lori Loughlin. Her sister Isabella Rose Giannulli and her were born with a lavish lifestyle thanks to their parents, which helped them get into several career opportunities that would be harder for non-showbiz parents' kids.</p><p>In a vlog she previously posted on her Youtbe channel years ago, she mentioned that both her parents did not have the privilege of getting into college. That is why their parents, Mossimo and Lori, were adamant about making sure Olivia and her sister would get into college, unlike them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Olivia mentioned in her vlog that she wasn't a big fan of college, not as much as her parents were, as she thinks if her parents didn't get into college but were still as successful as they are now, then she could do it too.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Olivia Jade Giannulli's Relationship Status And 7 Other Things To Know About Lori Loughlin's Daughter</a></span></p><p>Olivia's parents disagreed with their daughter's reasoning; they took it into their hands to ensure their two daughters would get into college and enter an Ivy League school. Their eagerness to make Olivia and Isabella Rose join the University of South California reached a point where they were willing to pay a vast amount of money and forge facts about their daughters to make USC's admissions accept them. And that is how Olivia Jade got involved in the most prominent college admissions scandal in the United States.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=olivia-jade-was-featured-in-operation-varsity-blues-the-college-admissions-scandal-documentary>Olivia Jade Was Featured In Operation Varsity Blues: The College Admissions Scandal Documentary</h2><p>A <a href=#>Netflix</a> documentary featuring the real story of the whole college admissions scandals made by the mastermind Rick Singer premiered on March 2021. It immediately became part of Netflix's trending list after viewers discovered how bizarre the bribing forgery was between Rick, the parents, the school's admission, and the high school students.</p><p>The Netflix documentary featured Olivia Jade alongside her family. The film revealed that Olivia's parents were sentenced to imprisonment for bribing USC with money to get Olivia and her sister in—which they successfully did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, immediately after the admissions scandal was revealed, Olivia Jade dropped out of college and focused on her thriving Youtube career.
