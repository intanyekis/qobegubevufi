In the meanwhile, Shutes was escorted off the court by other Memphis personnel.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Jenna Lemoncelli of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">New York Post</a>, Brett was the one to start this punching nuisance. Shutes took an elbow to the face late in the first half and later elbowed Brett in the face during the second half.</p><p>The controversial game took place on Bowling Green State University’s home ground in Bowling Green, Ohio.&nbsp;</p><p>In a statement issued by the BGSU administration, it was highlighted that the school’s police department had launched an investigation into the nasty altercation.</p><p>On Friday, March 24, 2023, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TMZ Sports</a> reported that Bowling Green officials confirmed that Shutes was being charged with assault on Friday morning.</p><p>Officials also said Brett is “recovering and doing well” despite experiencing some swelling in her right eye.&nbsp;</p><p>The punch thrower and the receiver are senior members of their respective teams. However, despite being punched, Brett was the second on the team in scoring in Thursday’s win.&nbsp;</p><p>The viral punch occurred after Bowling Green defeated the Memphis Tigers 73-60 in the third round of the Women’s National Invitational Tournament in Ohio on Thursday night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>After the incident, the school issued a statement, <strong>“Bowling Green State University Athletics does not comment about active police investigations. Our priority is with the health, safety, and support of our student-athletes.”</strong></p><p>Jamirah Shutes’ punch video is bringing all kinds of negative attention to the school and the tournament.&nbsp;</p><p>While Shutes and the 22-11 Tigers saw their season come to an end Thursday, Brett and the 30-6 Falcons have at least one more game on their schedule.</p><p>On Wednesday, March 29th, the defendant pled not guilty to the charges of assault. Shutes’ attorney, Steven Crossmock, appeared in court in Ohio on the Tigers player’s behalf to submit the plea.&nbsp;</p><p>She will tentatively be due back in court for another hearing in the case next month.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC2wKagq5mYYsCpwdOeqmaopaOwqXnVopuep12ovLOxjKWmrJ2iYrCprdGgnJ1lp57BqXnArKqarZypfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alan-bersten.html><span>←</span><span>Is Dancing With The Stars Winner, Alan Bersten Dating Anyone Currently?
