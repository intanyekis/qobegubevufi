Created by <strong>Jennie Snyder Urman</strong>, the Golden Globe-nominated TV show first came on the scene in 2014 and lasted for five seasons before its satisfying conclusion.</p><p class=p1>The series’ cast was led by <a href=#><strong>Gina Rodriguez</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Justin Baldoni</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Brett Dier</strong> </a>in main roles, with scene-stealing supporting performances by <a href=#><strong>Yara Martinez</strong></a>, <strong>Bridget Regan</strong>, <strong>Anthony Mendez </strong>and so many more.&nbsp;Rodriguez, for her part, starred as the titular character, Jane Villanueva. In the series premiere, Jane is <a href=#>a 23-year-old virgin</a> who learns she’s pregnant after <a href=#>accidentally being artificially inseminated</a> by her doctor. In a split second, Jane’s entire life changes — as do her relationships with her boyfriend (<a href=#>and eventual husband</a>), Michael Cordero (Dier), and the baby’s father, Rafael Solano (Baldoni).</p><p class=p1>The show <a href=#>became a major hit and led plenty of its cast members to stardom</a>, including <a href=#>a Golden Globe trophy for Rodriguez</a>.</p><p class=p1>“It’s interesting — but fun! This is a real thing families deal with this all the time, new people coming in. I love the way our show delicately and educationally the subject,” the&nbsp;<i>Man Enough&nbsp;</i>author <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in October 2017</a> of playing Rafael and working on the dramedy. “[Rafael and I would] both take a bullet for our children. We want them to have better lives and opportunities than we did. But I wouldn’t compromise my beliefs or morals because I don’t place the same value on wealth and financial security that he does. The biggest difference is that I have a strong spiritual belief and Rafael doesn’t because he’s so hurt and broken.”</p><p class=p1>One thing that Baldoni wasn’t as excited about? Whenever <a href=#>the hotel owner needed to strip down</a>. “I cringe when there’s a shirtless scene because I never feel I am in good enough shape,” he told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>at the time. “I struggle with the difference between how Justin looks and how Rafael is supposed to look. To me, I’ll always be the skinny kid with the narrow shoulders. I think it’s cool to talk about because a lot of men don’t.”</p><p class=p1><i>Jane the Virgin</i>, which takes inspiration from classic telenovelas, <a href=#>aired its final episode in July 2019</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“We started shooting the first season of&nbsp;<i>Jane</i>&nbsp;in July 2014. A few days into shooting I turned 30 on set. Yesterday I turned 35. And today is the very last episodes, 99 and 100 airing of&nbsp;<i>Jane The Virgin.</i>&nbsp;Five years. Five years of love, laughter, growth, pain, surprises, deaths, new births and a s—t ton of memories,” Rodriguez wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> amid the series finale. “I will never stop making art to bring Joy and Laughter into your home/train ride/plane ride or classroom! Art is my savior. Art is what makes me feel like I can fly. … I will always love you, Jane.”</p><p class=p1><i>Jane the Virgin&nbsp;</i>launched plenty of careers and captured many hearts during its television tenure.
