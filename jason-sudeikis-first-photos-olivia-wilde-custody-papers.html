(SplashNews)In one photo, Jason was dressed in the typical outfit that fans of the show know. He sported a dark blue sweater over a button-down shirt with a pair of khakis and Nike sneakers. Of course, he had his facial hair shaved into the signature mustache that the character is known for. In one of the behind-the-scenes looks, he rocked a pair of blue pants and a green jacket, with a backpack behind him.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Jason’s ex-wife Olivia was served legal papers while speaking on-stage at CinemaCon in the middle of a presentation where she was speaking about one of her new movies. The 38-year-old actress was handed a large legal envelope at the Las Vegas event and realized that they were custody papers and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>continued presenting</a> as part of the convention. Olivia and Jason share a son&nbsp;<strong>Otis,&nbsp;</strong>8, and&nbsp;daughter&nbsp;<strong>Daisy,&nbsp;</strong>5.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jason-Sudeikis-1st-Pics-Ted-Lesso-Serving-Olivia-Wilde-Spl-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>A source revealed to&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>that Jason wasn’t told that the&nbsp;House&nbsp;actress would be served on-stage. They said that he ” had no prior knowledge of the time or place that the envelope would have been delivered as this would solely be up to the process service company involved.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Another source close to the situation told <strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>exclusively that Jason couldn’t have expected her getting served in this way. “Jason was just as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shocked as the rest of us</a> when he found out Olivia was served at CinemaCon,” they said. “Jason would never in a million years try to shame Olivia. She’s the mother of his kids and despite their relationship not working out he would never intentionally embarrass or humiliate her.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e49vZqOZo6S7br%2FUnZyio5moeqe10ayrZqiYpMGwv4yoo6KumZZ6uLXLnZxmm6WowbCw2GanmqiVp8Bw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-give-your-cat-catnip-vet-answer.html><span>←</span><span>How to Give Your Cat Catnip: Vet Explained Do's, Don'ts &amp;amp; FAQs</span></a>
