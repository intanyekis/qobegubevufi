After you do that, it's pretty damn hard to work with that person. And really what we should always be doing is questioning ideas, not the person."</p><p>Given his philosophy, he couldn't have selected a more deserving person for this astonishingly large monetary gift. USA Today confirms that Jones&nbsp;"founded the nonprofit organization Dream Corps, which tackles issues such as criminal justice reform and tech equity. He also works as a contributor for CNN."</p><p>When prompted for a response about this huge gift, Jones was visibly stunned and incredibly grateful.
