They claim that Morgan neglected to mention his friend during his televised speech or send well wishes for the deceased’s family since McNair’s death.</p><p>McNair’s sister Pamela told the <a href=# rel=nofollow>New York Daily News</a> on Monday, “I understand it’s been a great ordeal for Tracy over the last 15 months. I just feel in some form or fashion, he should have acknowledged my brother – his mentor – because he lost his life.”</p><p>Jimmy Mack’s son, Jamel McNair, was also vocal about his disdain towards Morgan. He took to Facebook Monday to write about the 30 Rock star’s lack of communication with him, his sister and the rest of the family since the accident.</p><p>“Send a smoke signal, give a call, text, send a damn pigeon,” he wrote. “There’s no excuse for this type of behavior.”</p><p>In June of this year, Morgan spoke to TODAY’s Matt Lauer in his first interview since the crash. He stated that he didn’t know McNair was dead until he awoke from his eight-day coma.</p><p>“He was a loving man and he was a warm man,” Morgan recalled of his late friend during the interview. “He was a good man. It’s just hard for me to see that he’s gone.” He also stated he watched his funeral on YouTube, since he was still in the hospital and couldn’t attend. Here are Jamel’s posts on the matter:</p><p>Morgan himself suffered a traumatic brain injury in the accident, but during the Emmy’s telecast, he cracked a few jokes during his speech, proving to the audience that his signature humor is well on its way back. He is set to host Saturday Night Live on Oct. 17.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2B2rrnYZqSam5tis6K5yKWwZqyilrC6ecyoqaCZnmKyrrnYZqqpnZWYtW5%2Flm9ubWlf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./irene-marie-voyles-obituary-beloved-irene-marie-passed-away-at-72.html><span>←</span><span>Irene Marie Voyles Obituary; Beloved Irene Marie Passed away At 72</span></a>
