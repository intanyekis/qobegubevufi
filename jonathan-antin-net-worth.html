He has been active since the 1990s.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Jonathan Antin is, as of early 2018? According to sources, it has been estimated that Jonathan Antin`s overall net worth is $4 million, an amount acquired through his numerous talents, and business ideas, including selling his own hair product, “Jonathan Product” in the beauty salons Sephora.</p><h3>Jonathan Antin Net Worth $4 Million</h3><p>Jonathan grew up in a family with two brothers – Steve Antin, who is a film director and Neil Antin an actor, plus sister Robin Antin, who is a founder of the musical group Pussycat Dolls. Before his professional career began, Jonathan attended the Fairfax Beauty Academy, and soon after graduation became a hair stylist at the West Hollywood salon. He worked there for quite some time, working his way up and increasing his net worth. Jonathan eventually bought the hair salon and renamed it “Jonathan Salon West Hollywood”, where he charged $500 for a haircut. Before long, Jonathan became one of the most popular and sought-after hair stylists, with some of his customers having included <a href=#>Rod Stewart</a>, <a href=#>Tiger Woods</a>, <a href=#>Madonna</a>, <a href=#>Kirsten Dunst</a>, and <a href=#>Kate Bosworth</a>, among others. This has certainly increased Jonathan`s net worth.</p><p>All this success enabled him to add a second salon which he opened in Beverly Hills, increasing further his net worth. While in the process of opening of his new salon, Jonathan was featured in the reality TV series “Blow Out” (2004), during the filming of which one of Jonathan`s customer was the famous fitness trainer <a href=#>Jackie Warner</a>.</p><p>The same year, Jonathan also featured as a judge of the Miss Teen USA Pageant, and also appeared in an episode of the “Bravo Show”, entitled “Queer Eye For The Straight Guy”, which certainly contributed to his net worth too.</p><p>Further on in his successful career on television, he was featured in the TV serial documentary “101 Guiltiest Guilty Pleasures” (2006), and in 2010 he appeared in the TV series “The Biggest Loser”, and as a guest star in the “CSI: Crime Scene Investigations”. The same year, Jonathan served as a judge in the reality TV series “Sheer Genius”, all of which also added to his net worth.</p><p>To speak further of his accomplishments, Jonathan has appeared in magazines such as Sense and Inked, and been featured in many others.</p><p>His more recent ventures include an appearance in the reality TV series “L.A Hair” (2015), and he is to launch a new hair product, as he canceled production of his past brand, Jonathan Product.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Jonathan was married to boutique owner Sescie Karabuykov from 2006 until 2011, when she filed for divorce; the couple have a son and a daughter.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=20.254504504505><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jonathan Antin</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$4 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 16, 1967</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Los Angeles County, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.8&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Hairdresser, Entrepreneur</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Beverly Hills High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Sescie Antin (m. 2006-2011)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Asher Jones Antin, Jocie Antin</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Brenda Antin, Michael Antin</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Robin Antin, Steve Antin, Neil Antin</td></tr><tr readability=0.2962962962963><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/jonathanantinfanpage/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/jonathanantin</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm1648002</a></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Movies</td><td>L.A Hair (2015), Blow Out (2004), Time of Your Life (1999), CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000)</td></tr><tr readability=13><td>TV Shows</td><td>Actors Entertainment (TV Series, 2014), Bravo Show: Queer Eye For The Straight Guy, The Biggest Loser (2010), Harry Loves Lisa: Comedy Club (TV Series, 2010), Shear Genius (2010), Wendy: The Wendy Williams Show (2010), The Tyra Banks Show (2005), Da Ali G Show (2003)</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=12.304347826087><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Celebrity hair stylist.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2</td><td>Has his own hair line called Johnathan, which is sold in the beauty store Sephora.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>3</td><td>Was a student at the Fairfax Beauty Academy and quickly landed a job at a trendy West Hollywood salon, which he purchased years later.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>4</td><td>Father, with Sescie, of two sons: Asher (born in 2006) and another child, whom they announced they had conceived on April 12, 2007.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>5</td><td>Owner of two Los Angeles hair salons: Jonathan Salon West Hollywood and Jonathan Salon Beverly Hills.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>6</td><td>Son, Asher Jones Antin, born 6th January 2006, with fiancée Sescie</td></tr><tr readability=1.3877551020408><td>7</td><td>Brother of <a href=#>Steve Antin</a>, <a href=#>Neil Antin</a>, <a href=#>Robin Antin</a>.</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Blow Out</td><td>2005-2006</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Jonathan</td></tr><tr><td>Time of Your Life</td><td>2000</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Hugo</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=7><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>L.A.
