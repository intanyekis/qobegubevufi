She is apparently asking the pop star to stop referring to her in songs, as she thinks she should be "over it" by now because it's been years, but this request backfired spectacularly, as people online have been referencing the scandal more than ever to remind Kim of how much Taylor was hurt during that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-kardashian-wants-taylor-swift-to-39-move-on-39>Kim Kardashian Wants Taylor Swift To 'Move On'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kim-kardashian-pic.jpg><p>According to a source, the reality TV star was bothered by the song "thanK you aIMee", but not exactly because of the lyrics attacking her. Reportedly, she just wants to move on from their feud, and is tired of Taylor Swift referencing it.</p><p><strong>"She’s over it and thinks Taylor should move on," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the source said</a>. Apparently, Kim Kardashian "doesn’t get why [Swift] keeps harping on it" since "it's been literally years."</strong></p><p>The song "thanK you aIMee" doesn't mention the SKIMS founder by name, but it wasn't difficult for fans to identify the name the seemingly random capital letters in the title formed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ttweb_a-look-at-kim-kardashian-s-net-worth-since-divorcing-kanye-west_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="A Look At Kim Kardashian's Net Worth Since Divorcing Kanye West">A Look At Kim Kardashian's Net Worth Since Divorcing Kanye West</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Kim Kardashian knows how to leverage her fame, so it's no wonder her divorce has barely made a dent in her net worth.</p><p>"All that time you were throwing punches / I was building something / And I can't forgive the way you made me feel / Screamed 'F**k you, Aimee' to the night sky / As the blood was gushing / But I can't forget the way you made me heal," the song lyrics read.</p><p><strong>Taylor Swift also seemed to mention the way their public feud affected her family, and how it's still affecting her to this day</strong>.</p><p>"Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman / But she used to say she wished that you were dead / I pushed each boulder up the hill / Your words are still just ringing in my head, ringing in my head."</p><h2 id=fans-defended-taylor-swift-not-moving-on-from-the-fight>Fans Defended Taylor Swift Not Moving On From The Fight</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-andrea-finlay-swift.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim Kardashian's response to the song wasn't well received online, and not only by swifties. Even people who admittedly aren't Taylor Swift fans are saying that, for Taylor to move on, Kim Kardashian should apologize for the harm she caused the singer.</p><p><strong>For those who don't remember <a href=#>the famous feud</a>, when Kim Kardashian was married to Kanye West, she released an edited phone call to "prove" that Taylor Swift had authorized the rapper to name drop her in a song where he said he "made that b*tch famous." After the fake phone call was leaked, Taylor was relentlessly bullied, to the point where she had to leave the country and fell into a deep depression</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They are referring, of course, to the music video Kanye West made that featured a naked doll of Taylor Swift. His and Kim Kardashian's actions, added to the aggression she received from their followers, changed Taylor's life forever.</p><p><strong>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">That took me down psychologically</a> to a place I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard."</strong></p><p>Knowing all this, it's unlikely Taylor will move on from the incident any time soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmLBosXLqKlmq6ees7V5w6KqrGWkqb2ledKhpq6klGKvpnnOr5yrZZmpfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./blue-ivy-carter-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>How Is Jay Z And Beyonce's Daughter Already So Rich?</span></a>
