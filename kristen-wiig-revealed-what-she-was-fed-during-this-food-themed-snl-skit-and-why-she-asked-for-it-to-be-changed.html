The sketch comedy show has turned some very talented comedians into household names. From Eddie Murphy to Adam Sandler, SNL is the original home to some of Hollywood's brightest comedic stars.</p><p>Therefore, it should come as no surprise that actress and comedian Kristen Wiig first stepped into America's homes after appearing on SNL. <a href=#>The funny performer became known for her hilarious characters</a>, including Penelope and the Target Clerk lady.</p><p>But there was another character Wiig portrayed that audiences wanted back for another round. This was an impersonation of a famous actress. However, when filming the second scene, Wiig requested a specific change to one key detail.</p><h2 id=kristen-revealed-that-she-was-fed-real-activia-yogurt-when-parodying-jamie-lee-curtis-39-commercials>Kristen Revealed That She Was Fed Real Activia Yogurt When Parodying Jamie Lee Curtis' Commercials</h2><p>Wiig's characters on Saturday Night Live have been both memorable and enjoyable for the audience. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When Wiig spoke to Women's Health in 2008</a>, she shared where some of these characters came from, like Penelope.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Penelope was a character who was constantly one-upping people.</p><p>"A lot of it comes from just unconsciously observing people," Wiig said. "Penelope is based on someone I know. It's so far from how they act or look that they would never in a million years know. I'd say I was going to get a massage and they'd say, 'Oh, I'm getting a massage this week. I'm getting one tomorrow.' And I'd be like, 'That's a weird thing to try to one-up someone about, but OK.'"</p><p>She also shared that she loves Target as much as her Target Clerk character does.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's clean," Wiig said. "They have great things. It's every reason you love a store."</p><p>Similar to Penelope, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiig told Entertainment Weekly that the Target Clerk character was inspired by a real clerk at a Target store she encountered</a>.</p><p>"She didn’t walk away and she didn’t talk like that or look like that," Wiig said. "She just said a word kind of funny that got me to talk that way."</p><p>One of Wiig's most memorable characters, however, wasn't a fictional creation. It was actually an impression of actress Jamie Lee Curtis.</p><p>Wiig parodied Curtis' commercials for the Activia digestive yogurt brand. Wiig first appeared in a skit alongside Ashton Kutcher and Amy Poehler, where Curtis has an accident during filming. The skit was received so well, that Wigg played Curtis again in another skit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/here-s-what-troye-sivan-really-thought-of-timothe-e-chalamet-imitating-him-on-saturday-night-live-front-deposit-back-snl_youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Troye Sivan Really Felt About Timothée Chalamet Imitating Him On Saturday Night Live</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Troye Sivan reacted with shock on social media after the "Call Me By Your Name" actor portrayed him in a skit.</span><p>However, Wiig revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she actually ate multiple cups of real Activia yogurt to film the skit. She asked them to switch to regular yogurt for the second skit.</p><p>"Then I told them it was a bad idea," Wiig said, "that’s how I’m going to word that. It works. Now they fill it with regular yogurt."</p><h2 id=kristen-talked-to-will-forte-in-preparation-for-her-39-saturday-night-live-39-audition>Kristen Talked To Will Forte In Preparation For Her 'Saturday Night Live' Audition</h2><p>Before Wiig began her journey as an actress and comedian, she told Women's Health about the moment she decided she wanted to pursue this career.</p><p>"It was the day before I was about to start," she began. "I was living in a house with three other girls, who were gone for the summer, so it was just me. I remember looking around and thinking, 'I don't want this to be my life.' Then I looked in the mirror and was like, 'OK, if you could do anything, what would it be?' And I thought, 'I would move to L.A. Just try to act.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Even though I'd only ever taken one acting class. The next day, the Jetta was packed and I was gone, freaking out the whole way."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar48948376.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When speaking to The New York Times in 2013</a>, she revealed she talked to Will Forte before her audition and was prepped by her manager beforehand.</p><p>"I talked to Will Forte [in preparation]," Wiig said. "My manager had some of her other clients audition, so she knew the deal. I was told: 'You’re going to be in a dark room. Don’t be thrown off if they don’t laugh. You don’t need wigs or props. Just do five minutes.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/your-paragraph-text-2023-10-20t121005-876.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Madonna And Lady Gaga Drove Everyone Crazy Preparing For Their Saturday Night Live Skit</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Lady Gaga revealed that she and Madonna were "quite militant about rehearsals" during "Saturday Night Live."</span><p>Wigg ended up buying a stopwatch, because she was nervous her audition would go past five minutes. However, she later learned some auditions lasted 11 minutes. Regardless, Wiig's initial audition went well and she was asked to stay an extra day and meet SNL creator Lorne Michaels.</p><h2 id=kristen-said-that-she-feels-safer-playing-a-character-than-she-does-socializing-with-people>Kristen Said That She Feels Safer Playing A Character Than She Does Socializing With People</h2><p>When Wiig was called back to audition a second time, she was unsure of what to do.</p><p>"I’m not a stand-up, so I don’t ever perform onstage by myself," Wiig said. "This was: “'Hi, I’m Kristen. Here’s my stuff.' The only light in the room is on you. You hear voices, and you see the red light on the camera go on, and you just have to do it. It made me have such a stronger respect for comedians — people that just get up there with a microphone and talk to the audience. To me, that’s just terrifying."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar48532344.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite being a terrifying experience, Wiig said that performing on stage as a character is much more comfortable than speaking on stage as herself.</p><p>"I'm actually not very good at public speaking or talking in a big group—even socially—as myself," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiig told NPR</a>. "Playing a character is much safer to me. So getting up and someone telling me to do a monologue as a character, I could talk for 10 minutes. But if someone told me to get up and be myself and talk, I would have a much harder time with that."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Billie-Eilish-SNL.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What Happened To Billie Eilish Behind The Scenes On Saturday Night Live?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Billie Eilish had a memorable experience on SNL, but prior to appearing on the program, she struggled backstage.</span><p>She continued, "I think a lot of people assume that you are what you do. And that happens to me all the time when I do interviews, or even when I just like, go to a dinner. I think people think I’m going to throw on a wig and start tap-dancing on the table."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiiq6GjqbKvedaioKBloprDpq3Lnptmr5iWwW6%2Fx55ksJmjYrOmsIydrKuhnpx6tbTIrGSfp5%2BZerW0xKacnWWjo7luv8qiq2aZnpl6uLTYZqqhnV2WwKyxw2adqKpdnsFuwM5mmZ5lk52ur7PEnWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sydney-marie-martenis-obituary.html><span>←</span><span>Sydney Marie Martenis Obituary: What Happened To Her?</span></a>
