The Enquirer featured her every few years and kept track of the progress of her nails.Redmond started growing her nails in late 1978-early 1979 and although she had originally planned to have them cut off on November 22, 2006 (as she said on her guest appearances on a couple of talk shows), she chose to keep her nails after all. In the past few years, she made appearances on CBS News and at the Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum. One of her last appearances was at a fundraiser for the Salt Lake City fire department, where it was reported her nails were an average of 34–35 inches in length.A great-grandmother of two, Lee currently resides in Salt Lake City, Utah. During the time when she had her long nails, she enjoyed activities such as riding bikes with her younger sister Sierra, who had normal nails. She stated that, while certain activities such as putting on a heavy coat were troublesome, she managed her daily life without much difficulty. On the Guinness TV feature, she was shown driving a car, vacuuming, doing dishes, and giving haircuts to her grandchildren. Lee has two sons, a daughter, two granddaughters and two grandsons. She is also a proud great-grandmother to two beloved great-grandchildren. She added that her long nails didn't even interfere with her care of her husband, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease.On February 10, 2009, her record-setting nails were broken off when she was ejected from a car in a four-car pile-up in Holladay, Utah. Her injuries were serious, but not life-threatening.In a Huffington Post story published on September 3, 2009 it was stated that: "Lee Redmond, who lost the fingernails in February, says it's now much easier to do things and her hands seem to fly with the weight of the nails gone. The 68-year-old won't grow her nails out again, saying it took 30 years the first time and she may not live for another 30." Her nails are currently about four inches long, however. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=8.5><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1.7 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 15, 1950</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Los Angeles, California, USA</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Camera Department, Cinematographer, Director</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Residence</td><td>Salt Lake City, Utah, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nicknames</td><td>Lee Redmond, Redmond, Lee, Lee Redmond</td></tr><tr><td>Star Sign</td><td>Scorpio</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Camera Department <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=camera_department readability=22.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>To the Moon, Alice</td><td>1991</td><td>Short camera operator: second unit</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</td><td>1991</td><td>camera operator -
