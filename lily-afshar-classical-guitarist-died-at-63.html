She was the first woman in the world to earn the Doctoral Degree in Classical Guitar. Although I was not a close friend, I was well acquainted with her. She and my daughter Virginia were good friends. Lily was a world-class musician and a guitar virtuoso. She knew she was good, in fact, she was great and traveled in a world occupied by few. She had played for Segovia and he said she had been touched by God. I always enjoyed her concerts; they always soared. Most, however, I remember the small venues where she helped fund-raising efforts for the Memphis Youth Symphony. Lily would donate her talent. When I was on the faculty at the University of Memphis we served on a few doctoral committees. Although these were music/history research projects (not performance) she was always fully engaged. She made the guitar department at the University of Memphis and had just retired after thirty-four years. She was bright, intelligent, talented and made the guitar sing.<h3 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lily_Afshar_Obituary></span><strong>Lily Afshar Obituary</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>We mourn the loss of Professor Lily Afshar, a woman whose influence stretched far beyond her music. She was a trailblazer, a virtuoso, and an inspiration to many. Her death marks a significant loss to the world of classical guitar and music as a whole. As we remember her life and contributions, we extend our deepest sympathies to her friends, family, and all those touched by her music.</p><p><strong>Michelle Shrader</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>Lily Afshar passed. Lily Afshar, the reason I moved to Memphis. The first woman to get a doctorate in classical guitar in the entire world. I moved to Memphis specifically bc when I heard her Hemispheres album, I was absolutely floored. Packed up, dropped out of Southern Louisiana University where I was studying classical guitar and moved to a little studio apartment in midtown Memphis. Way before all the skyscrapers. Way before Overton Square was cool again. When the Bucc was still alive. I’d practice til midnight at school and go to the bucc to relax, listen to others play music. Dave Cousar, Charlie Wood, rock/grunge/whatever. P & H where my Dad and I beat Lily and Marcin Dylla in a game of pool. Someone I spoke to in some shape or form for 6 years while she was my mentor in undergrad. She had lots of bad (terribly complicated) qualities, but like they say, there’s always some good in there too. My heart hurts. She grew and shaped me as a musician. I learned so much from her. I wouldn’t be in Memphis if it wasn’t for Lily. Goodbye, Lily.<p>Lily Afshar’s passing is a reminder of the profound impact one individual can have on an industry. Her legacy as a barrier-breaking female guitarist will continue to inspire future generations of musicians. As we mourn her loss, we also celebrate her incredible contributions to the world of music.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminqJyusb%2BNqKmgZ5yeubp5wJ%2BqoZmiYrCtrdKsoJyZnGK0trXTmqmiq6Risaqxw2aYrWVmaHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justin-moses-age-how-old-is-he-meet-the-musician-on-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Justin Moses Age How Old Is He? -Meet The Musician On Instagram</span></a>
