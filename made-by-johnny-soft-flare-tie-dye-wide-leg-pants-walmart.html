Yes, we’ve all seen wide-leg lounge pants before, but these might take the cake as the ultimate in baggy brilliance! They remain fitted at the top and around the hip area just like a typical pair of high-waisted yoga pants or leggings, but once they hit the thigh, they flare out dramatically. If you’re standing straight with your legs side by side, it may even look like you’re wearing a maxi skirt!</p><p>Though the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pants are high-waisted</a>, you also have the option to fold over the top to create a mid-rise fit if that better suits your figure. The overall cut is super flattering, not to mention seriously comfy. One shopper said that this pair holds the title of the “most comfortable pants” they have ever worn. Color Us impressed!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Made-by-Johnny-Womens-Chic-Tie-Dye-Palazzo-Pants-2.png><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Made by Johnny Women’s Chic Tie Dye Palazzo Pants</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$17</a> at Walmart!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The different <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tie-dye options</a> up for grabs are incredible — you can easily find a version of these pants in your favorite color! All of them have a monochromatic style so they’re not as bright and in-your-face as multicolored versions, and you can find tons of tops that will look stunning teamed with these bottoms. Whether you decide to wear a yoga tank, bralette or cropped tee, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these pants</a> are going to become a go-to when lounging around at home or popping out for errands!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Made by Johnny Women’s Chic Tie Dye Palazzo Pants</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$17</a> at Walmart!&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Not what you’re looking for?
