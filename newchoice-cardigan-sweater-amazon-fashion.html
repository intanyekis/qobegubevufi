The Shop With Us team aims to highlight products and services our readers might find interesting and useful, such as <a href=# rel=noopener>wedding-guest outfits</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>purses</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>plus-size swimsuits</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>women's sneakers</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>bridal shapewear</a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener>perfect gift ideas</a> for everyone in your life.

Jeans are usually blue, flannels are usually plaid and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cardigans</a> are usually made of a thick knit. We know there are other varieties for all of these pieces and more, but we often have to specifically search for them and actively go buy them.</p><p>We’re here to focus on cardigans right now. They don’t have to be chunky, heavy or made of wool. They don’t even need to have buttons or be a neutral color. If the idea of something lightweight, drapey, easy to style and totally cute appeals to you (duh!), then this <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Newchoice cardigan</a> could change your closet for the better. It’s on sale too!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Newchoice Lightweight Soft Drape Long-Sleeve Cardigan</a> (originally $30) for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$26</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, October 4, 2022, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>We spotted this unique sweater on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon’s cardigan bestsellers list</a>, which is updated hourly, so you know it’s extra popular with shoppers right now. It has so many reviews to back it up too! It’s made of a lightweight, jersey type of viscose, so it feels like a soft, breathable, drapey tee rather than a heavy knit sweater. It adds a touch of spandex as well for stretch!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This cardigan</a> is totally open in front, nixing all buttons and other types of closures. Its hem is long, reaching past the hips to about mid-thigh, adding some really nice flow to this piece. This totally dresses it up too, making this piece great for nicer occasions. You could wear it over your dress to a chilly fall wedding or out for a date!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Newchoice Lightweight Soft Drape Long-Sleeve Cardigan</a> (originally $30) for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$26</a> at Amazon!

You’ll find bright purple, baby blue, teal and red in the mix, among many others. There’s a leopard print option as well that we know will excite many shoppers!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This cardigan</a> will be great to wear with T-shirts and jeans, but as we mentioned before, you can dress it up a little too. You might wear it over a crop top and leggings one day and a slip dress with heels the next. You just need to pick a color — or maybe grab two while it’s on sale!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Newchoice Lightweight Soft Drape Long-Sleeve Cardigan</a> (originally $30) for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$26</a> at Amazon!
