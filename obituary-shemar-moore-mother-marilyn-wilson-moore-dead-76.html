Soaps.com learned she passed away on Saturday February 8. Moore explained he had been absent online since the sudden death, which he attributed to heart problems and Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and had been doing a lot of crying and screaming. The mother and son were incredibly close, with Marilyn being the first person Moore called when he won his Daytime Emmy (during his acceptance speech), doing appearances together, and as he noted in his emotional video announcement in which he held up a photo of his mother, they had traveled the world together more than once. Gutted by the loss, Moore stated, “I don’t know how to do this life without her …. but I get my STRENGTH from her and I will be OK because of HER.” The actor also shared two tribute clips to his mother set to music, which we’ve posted below.</p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Love of Life actress Ja’net DuBois passes away</a></p><p>Marilyn Wilson-Moore was the daughter of the late Herbert and Marie Wilson of Brighton, Massachusetts, where she was born on September 6, 1943.
