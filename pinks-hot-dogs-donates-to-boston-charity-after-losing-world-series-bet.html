Pink’s Hot Dogs, a famous Los Angeles restaurant that’s been visited by stars such as <a href=#><strong>Katy Perry</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Liev Schreiber</strong></a>, has donated $500 to a Boston-based charity after losing a World Series bet.</p><p>The wager was made between Richard Pink, the second-generation owner of Pink’s, and Dave Gettleman, the owner of Spike’s Junkyard Dogs in Allston, Massachusetts, after Pink searched for a Boston hot dog stand that would bet on the sporting event with him. “I thought they had a really interesting name and seemed like a quality hot dog stand,” Pink told <a href=#>Delish</a>.</p><p>According to the outlet, Pink has placed a Dodger-related bet at least once before. In 2017, the restaurateur put money on his home team when they played the Houston Astros in the World Series that year and, just like in 2018, ended up forking over money to a Houston-based hot dog restaurant, Good Dog Houston, after his team lost.</p><p>However, per the terms of this year’s bet, Pink and Gettleman agreed to wager money for a good cause. “We decided on $500, but we made it in the interest of our favorite charities,” Pink noted. If the L.A. Dodgers won, Spike’s would donate to the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation, and if the Boston Red Sox were victorious, Pink’s would give the money to the Jimmy Fund in Boston to support cancer care and research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.</p><p>Over the course of the five-game series, which the Sox won 4-1, Pink’s and Spike’s playfully ribbed each other on social media. In one instance, the Pink’s Twitter account poked fun at a Red Sox player who threw his mitt to the ground in frustration, while the Spike’s account shared clips of the series slowly slipping from the Dodgers grasp.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Still, when the Red Sox officially won the World Series in Game 5 on Sunday, October 28, after beating the Dodgers 5-1, Pink’s promptly congratulated them, <a href=#>tweeting</a>, “Congratulations to the @RedSox and @SpikesBoston! Great series. Great win.”</p><p>“I do it with a smile because I’m glad our money is going to a great cause,” Pink said of writing a $500 check to the Jimmy Fund. “If I go to Boston, I would love to go to Spike’s, shake Dave’s hand, congratulate him on the World Series, and share a couple hot dogs.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqmhnqDAbrTOrWSdp5eoeqW7zZqrnqtdqbxurs6sq6imXZi1or7IrbBmmZapsrN5y6iqoqaXYsSwvsudZKydop6ytHnBnqto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./most-expensive-matchbox-cars.html><span>←</span><span>Most Expensive Matchbox Cars in 2024 Valuable Matchbox Cars</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=./></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
