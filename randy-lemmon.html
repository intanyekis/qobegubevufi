Lee and then graduated from Texas A&M University with a Bachelor’s in Journalism in 1984. Fittingly while studying at A&M he lived at the Moses Hall residence. Adding to the impressive list of accomplishments during his career was also a Master’s degree in Agriculture obtained while working for their renowned College of Agriculture. But at the end of the day, what mattered most to him was spending time with his children, Selena and Randal; supporting them both as Selena pursued her dream of becoming a musician and Randal devoted himself to tennis competitions all over the world.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rajasdentalcollege.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/WhatsApp-Image-2023-01-05-at-4.53.07-PM-1-edited.webp><p><strong>Read this also: <a href=#>How Did Joseph Koo Die, HK Musician and Composer Joseph koo Dies Aged</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_Randy_Lemmon_die></span><strong>How did Randy Lemmon die?&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Houston community was shocked on January 5th when Randy Lemmon, a beloved radio host and personality, passed away.

Unfortunately, Randy passed away due to a stroke.</p><p>In addition to his family, he leaves behind his sister Terri Langer (Ron) as well as sisters-in-law Jennifer Spriggs (Kevin) and Melissa Salce (Joab). His nieces and nephews – Lindsey Langer, Lauren Langer., Jessica Spriggs, Jamie Spriggs, Paighton Salce, Preston Salce and Parker Salce – will deeply miss him. His love of gardening enabled others to connect with nature in a way they probably never had before.</p><p>His aunt and uncle, Janelle and Ron Stokes, certainly feel that loss, along with their two sons, Conner and Reid. For over 35 years, Randy showed those lucky enough to benefit from his counsel the way forward when it comes to lawns, gardens, and outdoor life in this particular climate.
