Naldo is eager to help him with his experiments. He hasn’t really changed! [laughs]</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_16"></span><p><b>Q) What was it that made you want to be a part of the show?&nbsp;</b></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_12"></span><p>A) He was such a dude! [laughs] I mean, who doesn’t want chest hair, am I right?</p><p><b>Q) What have you added to your role as Naldo that wasn’t originally scripted for you?</b></p><p>A) I made it more me. I, honestly, wouldn’t say I’m such a hunk, but for me I just made Naldo so much more fun and random. I’d really like to think I’m a lot like Naldo and Naldo is a lot like me</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_19"></span><p><b>Q) The cast has such great chemistry. Was it instant when you all began working together or did it take some time to develop?&nbsp;</b></p><p>A) We’re all like family. There’s always that point in time when you meet somebody and it’s kind of awkward, but I bonded with them in an instant. I love all of them!</p><p><b>Q) You have great comedic timing. Is it something that has come naturally to you or have you had to work at in some way?&nbsp;</b></p><p>A) It definitely was new to me with how the laughs work, but I started to understand when the audience laughs you have to wait before you say your lines again. [laughs] Or else they can’t hear you!</p><p><b>Q) Who could you see Naldo paired with if he were to get a love interest, Cyd or Shelby, and why?</b></p><p>A) Why not both of them? Why can’t it be a love triangle? Doesn’t that work? [laughs]</p><p><b>Q) You are also in the music group Forever In Your Mind. How did you all come together?</b></p><p>A) We all came about in X-Factor. Liam joined the group a little over a year ago and we have been staying strong ever since. Love my bros!</p><p><b>Q) Who are some of your musical inspirations?</b></p><p>A) Justin Timberlake, 5SOS and Bruno Mars.</p><p><b>Q) Can fans expect an upcoming album from FIYM in the near future?&nbsp;</b></p><p>A) I would hope so, but be on the look out for some big news that could lead forward to an album!</p><p><b>Q) Who would you most like to collaborate with on a song?</b></p><p>A) 5SOS, for sure. I love their music and I would love to see what we come up with as like a seven piece.</p><p><b>Q) The band’s cover of “Shake Your Booty” is soon to be released. How did you guys decide to take on this song?</b></p><p>A) It was kind of an “Uptown Funk” kind of style. But, of course, we had to keep it old school so we put the funk in funky – if you know what I’m saying!</p><p><b>Q) You are a part of social media. Why is that such an important way for you to connect with your fans?&nbsp;</b></p><p>A) I want to be able to interact with as many fans as I can. So, if I have any free time, I like to talk to everyone on Twitter most of the time and give them my love!</p><p><b>Q) What would you like to say to everyone who is a fan and supporter of you and your work?&nbsp;</b></p><p>A) Keep on mindering and stay cool! I love each and everyone of you.</p><h3>About InformationCradle Editorial Staff</h3><p>This Article is produced by <strong>InformationCradle Editorial Staff</strong> which is a team of expert<strong> writers</strong> and <strong>editors</strong> led by <a href=#><strong>Josphat Gachie</strong></a> and trusted by millions of readers worldwide.</p><p>We endeavor to keep our content <strong>True</strong>, <strong>Accurate</strong>, <strong>Correct</strong>, <strong>Original</strong> and <strong>Up to Date</strong>.
