In the film version, Gosling portrays past-his-prime stuntman Colt Seavers, with Blunt, 41, playing former camera operator-turned-director Jody Moreno, who also happens to be Colt’s ex-girlfriend.</p><p>In describing the tender Swiftie moment from the film, <a href=#>Blunt</a> joked that she couldn’t get Gosling “ out of his emotions in that scene,” adding that the song was “so perfect.”</p><p>In a separate interview, Blunt raved about Gosling’s performance.</p><p>“The scene was sort of scripted to a certain extent, and then we were able just to improv, and that’s always the fun part because he’s such a master at it and it’s so joyful doing those kinds of scenes with Ryan,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>Collider</a> in an interview published on Tuesday, April 23. “I think that scene is fun to play because it’s sort of the aftermath of the fire burn scene, so maybe she’s a little ashamed about what she did, but she kind of loved it as well. It feels quite cleansed after it. It’s them awkwardly trying to find their feet with each other again. It was such a fun one to do.”</p><p>Swift, 34, originally released “All Too Well” on her fourth studio album, Red, in 2012. Following a dispute regarding the ownership of her masters, Swift re-recorded the song as “Taylor’s Version” and released a “10 Minute Version” as part of the re-recorded album Red (Taylor’s Version) in November 2021.</p><p>Earlier this month, Gosling and Blunt performed their own version of “All Too Well” when the Barbie star <a href=#>hosted Saturday Night Live</a> for the third time on April 13 to promote The Fall Guy.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m not gonna make any jokes about Ken,” he teased at the top of the show, referring to his character from Barbie. “Because it’s not funny. Ken and I … we had to break up.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Gosling said he got in “too deep” with Ken, adding that leaving the character behind felt like the end of a relationship. “And for processing a breakup, there’s really only one thing that can help,” he continued. “The music of the great Taylor Swift.”</p><p>After watching <a href=#>the SNL performance</a>, Swift was full of praise.</p><p>“All Too Well (Ryan and Emily’s Version) !!!” the 14-time Grammy winner wrote via her Instagram Story on Sunday, April 14, alongside a clip from the episode. “Watch me accidentally catch myself singing this version on tour. This monologue is EVERYTHING.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarsZGjeqi70qWgp59dmsWxuMCipaxlk6fGqrrGZquoZaSWxq270WaqsKGWqcBurculZK2nn2LEprjLaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fans-are-accusing-kylie-jenner-of-copying-kanye-wests-yeezy-design-with-new-fashion-range-kye.html><span>←</span><span>Fans Are Accusing Kylie Jenner Of Copying Kanye West's Yeezy Design With New Fashion Range Kye</span></a>
