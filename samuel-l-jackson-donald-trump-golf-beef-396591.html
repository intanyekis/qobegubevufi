And I haven’t been there in four or five years, so I had my assistant call. They said it was for membership dues. And I said, ‘I’m not a member,’ and they said, ‘Yeah, you are — you have a member number.’ Apparently he’d made me a member of one of his golf clubs, and I didn’t even know it!”</p><p>Asked if he thinks he’s a better golfer than Trump, Jackson replied confidently, noting that Trump is a cheat on the golf course.</p><p>“I am, for sure,” he said. “I don’t cheat.”</p><p>Trump got word of Jackson’s interview, and took to Twitter to claim that he did not know the actor, and had never played golf with him. He also took the opportunity to call Jackson “boring,” writing that he “does too many TV commercials:”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I don’t know <a href=# rel=nofollow>@SamuelLJackson</a>, to best of my knowledge haven’t played golf w/him & think he does too many TV commercials—boring.
