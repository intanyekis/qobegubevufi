Maybe she did this,’ and kept coming up with difference scenarios.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Later that night, as the Oscar winner and her longtime photographer boyfriend, <strong>Bryan Randall</strong>, were putting Louis to bed it was clear his conscious was bothering him. “He’s like, ‘I don’t feel well. I have this tickling in my stomach. I have to tell you something,’” Bullock recalled. “I said, ‘Okay, what is it?’ He goes, ‘I can’t tell you because I just like her so much.’”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sandra-bullock-on-ellen.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Still, the siblings have their battles. “There are moments when they want to kill each other,” quipped the Ocean’s 8 star. According to Bullock, Laila (pronounced Lila) tends to be the aggressor: “Laila is more likely to get irritated with her brother. But I like that about her. I like that she’ll take a knife and cut a guy.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Though the children couldn’t be more different, it works “in this best way,” Bullock explained. “He can use some of what she’s got and she can use what he has. They balance each out.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Bullock became mom to Louis in 2010 via adoption. At Louis’ request, in 2015, she adopted foster child Laila, who was age 3 at the time.
