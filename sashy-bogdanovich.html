Similarly, she hasn’t disclosed her annual earnings at this time, but we may assume she has made a solid living from her acting profession. Modeling and brand endorsement, sponsored contracts, and compensated partnerships all help Sashy supplement her income.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/kkk-1.jpg><p>Peter Bogdanovich, her father, was reported to have a net worth of <strong>$10 million</strong> at the time of his death. This includes Peter’s home, bank account, and other assets. His American filmmaker, producer, director-actor, and writer work has netted him this substantial fortune. If he hadn’t died, he was quite dedicated to his career; with this level of effort and attention to his work, his net source will undoubtedly rise in the near future.</p><h2>Who are the parents of Sasha Bogdanovich?</h2><p>On September 16, 1970, Sashy first opened her lovely pair of eyes. Bogdanovich was born and reared in the United States of America, in the city of Los Angeles. She will be 51 years old in 2022. Similarly, she cuts her birthday cake every year on December 16th. Alexandra Bogdanovich is her given name. Her zodiac sign is Virgo, which she was born under. She was also born as the daughter of Peter Bogdanovich (father) and Polly Platt (mother) (mother).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/aaa.jpg><p>Her father is a film director and producer, while her mother is a screenwriter and producer.

Sashy, on the other hand, is a devout Christian.</p><h2>Is Sasha Bogdanovich married? Who is her Husband?</h2><p>Sashy is a married woman who is content with her life. On May 17, 2003, she married Pax Bartholomew Wassermann, who had been her long-time boyfriend. Pax is a professional editor and producer. Similarly, there is no information on when they first met and when they began dating, but we may presume that they knew each other through their professional lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ddd-1.jpg><p>Peter and Polly married in 1962, although she was still living with her parents. In front of their family and friends, they had a lavish wedding. Similarly, there is no precise information on when they initially met and when they began dating at this time. This couple divorced in 1971 after being married for nine years. Platt, meanwhile, requested a divorce from Peter because Peter was dating Cybill Shepherd, the actress from the film The Last Picture Show.</p><h2>What is the height of Sashy Bogdanovich?</h2><p>Sashy has a height of 5 feet and 6 inches.
