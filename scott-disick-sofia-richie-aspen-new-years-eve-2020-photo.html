Scott posted a photo of himself taking off on a private jet on Instagram on Dec. 30, and then Sofia filled her Instagram Story up with more information about where they were headed. She posted photos of snow-capped mountains from the plane, as well as a tour of the lavish house they’re staying in. The pair are also joined by their pal, <strong>Darren Dzienciol</strong>, who is the co-owner of 1OAK.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Darren posted a photo to his Instagram Story of the trio posing for a mirror selfie. Scott is front and center in the pic, wearing sunglasses and a puffy blue winter jacket. Meanwhile, Sofia looks chic in her tan coat and black leather gloves, with her hair slicked back into a bun. She shared photos of her full outfit on Instagram, which included chic white pants and brown snow boots, as well. “Home in my fav New Year’s location,” she wrote alongside the pics.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Scott and Sofia also spent New Year’s 2019 in Aspen, but during that trip, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>they were joined</a> by&nbsp;<strong>Kourtney Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Kim Kardashian</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Kanye West</strong>, along with Kim and Kourtney’s kids. This time, though, it looks like the KarJenners are not part of the ski trip, as Kourtney and her kids were photographed in Calabasas on the afternoon of Dec. 30.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Still, it appears that Scott and Sofia are on fine terms with Kourtney and her family, as they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>attended the KarJenner Christmas Eve party</a> on Dec. 24. Earlier this year, Scott, Sofia and Kourtney also took the kids to Finland for an amicable, blended family trip.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH5ze5JqZqybn6nBbrDIrKCco12ovKe1wGapopuYnrJurdKpnKdlnprEbsXEmqmsZZWrsm5%2Bj2tnZqiYpMGwew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jay-ripley-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jay Ripley Net Worth</span></a>
