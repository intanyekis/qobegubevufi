<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Terrence Howard: &amp;quot;I Choked&amp;quot; at Oscars 2015, Was Distracted By Oprah</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Is it funny yet? Last month, <strong><a href=#>Terrence Howard</a></strong> took the stage at Hollywood's Dolby Theatre to present nominees for the Best Picture category at the 87th Annual Academy Awards, and in his own words, completely "choked."</p><p>The Empire star, 45, addressed the blunder in a new interview with <strong><a href=#>Jimmy Fallon</a></strong> on The Tonight Show on Monday, March 2.</p><p>"I was worried about you for a second," host Fallon, 40, began. "Can I just talk about the Oscars for a second?"&nbsp;</p><p>Burying his head in his scarf and covering his eyes as Fallon broached the subject, Howard muttered "no," before shedding some light on exactly what went down.</p><p>"I'm at the Academy Awards," began Howard, who was nominated for his own Oscar for 2005's Hustle & Flow. "I mean, I got <strong><a href=#>Meryl Streep</a></strong>, I got all these dope, the best actors in the world, and they're up there reading [from] the teleprompter. I was like, 'Man, I can memorize that!' So everybody that went up there, I'm clowning them. I'm clowning, I'm talking to my wife, 'Look at this, man, I can do better than that, wait until I go up there! Watch this, watch till I go up there!'"</p><p></p><p>When it was finally his turn to take the stage, in a moment that has since become infamous, Howard spoke so bizarrely and slowly that social media users questioned if he was under the influence of something.</p><p>"I walk out there and, um, first and foremost, I forgot to wear a belt that day," Howard explained. "So, I'm pulling it up, I'm like, 'It's okay, my stomach will hold it up.'"&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I get out there and I'm breathing and I got this memorized, I've worked 18 hours to work this out, I'm 'bout to kill it," he continued. "I get out there… there's <strong><a href=#>Oprah</a></strong>! 'Hi Oprah… Oh, oh, read the lines, read the lines.' I try to look up and I'm like, 'No, I worked on this, I'm not going to read the prompter, I'm going to say it from heart'… I choked!"</p><p>Fallon then had Howard sit through the painfully awkward moment, giving a running dialogue of what he was thinking as he spoke. Watch Howard's narration of the presentation in the video above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKueqqKau6SxjKGmsJmimXqqecKhpqSdlGKutXnOrJqaqqNif3F9lGaumqtdmba0wNGamq2dlGKvunnOqamaoF1nfXKBkmxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./styles-p-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Styles P Net Worth</span></a>
