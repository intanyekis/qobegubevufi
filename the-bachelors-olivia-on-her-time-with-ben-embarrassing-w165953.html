But things spiraled out of control, thanks in part to her friction with the other women and her sometimes odd behavior around Ben, including hopping out of a cake for her talent performance. Despite Olivia frequently telling the camera that she was confident because of nonverbal clues he was apparently sending her, he gave her the boot during a two-on-one date in the February 8 episode.</p><p><span>Olivia spoke to<i> Us </i>at the Women Tell All taping on Saturday, February 27, where she admitted that she may have been a bit too focused on Higgins’ supposed hints.</span></p><p>“In that situation, you grab onto straws because you’re like, ‘He can’t really tell me he likes me, so he looked at me, he touched my leg’ — but it’s embarrassing, of course, to watch that,” she says. “I look into everything — I’m an over-analyzer.”</p><p><span>Olivia says she feels that she was “misunderstood” during her stint on the show.</span></p><p>“I think my sarcasm and my dry humor was interpreted sometimes [as] ‘I’m crazy’ or something,” she says. “And there were some situations that played out differently than they happened, but I just don’t think I ever made it to air. Like, the real me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The castoff, who says she was bullied as a “severely overweight” child, is pleased that she and the other ladies were able to talk out their differences on the Women Tell All episode, which airs Monday, March 7.</p><p>“I wish things could have been brought up [during the season], and I’m glad that I got to see kind of their side, and I’m glad they got to see my side,” she says. “I think we are all past it. We’ve been past it for a while, but we have to hash it out, and I feel really good. I’m at peace.”</p><p><span>Olivia still thinks she and Higgins could have been right together had they met outside of the show, but she is now ready to move on with her love life.</span></p><p>“I think if we had met outside of this sphere, we could have [made a good couple], but he was not the one for me,” she explains. “And that’s OK. I watched [the season], and I was like, ‘Yeah, OK, that wasn’t right.’ I was just so hyper-focused and so ready. But he’s an amazing man, and on paper, whoa — perfect for me. But he’s obviously incredibly happy with his choice, so I’m thrilled for him.”</p><p>“I’ll find my man eventually — it will happen!” she adds. “I’m in no rush!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><i>The Bachelor</i> airs on ABC on Mondays at 8 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2XrqS0xKWmq6tdpLmqwsiaZKimXZ2ys3nToqSeZaeewal5wZ6lZp2dl66zvsCsqqKml2LEcoKUcmxsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tekashi-6ix9ine-arrested-florida-failing-appear-court-1234779470.html><span>←</span><span>Tekashi 6ix9ine Arrested In Florida After Failing To Appear In Court</span></a>
