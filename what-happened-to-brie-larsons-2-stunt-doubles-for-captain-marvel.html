She's been <a href=#>a target of internet bullies since 2018</a> when she said: "I don’t need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn’t work about A Wrinkle in Time" during a Women in Film event. Her statement was widely misinterpreted that many fans still haven't forgiven her to this day. Starring in Avengers: Endgame and Captain Marvel the following year, they also began to <a href=#>criticize her for landing her MCU role</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At one point, netizens even <a href=#>attacked the actress for being so "defensive"</a> after Chris Hemsworth said that he did his own stunts during a joint interview with her and Don Cheadle for Entertainment Tonight. Larson said that she also did hers. The Thor actor then joked that she's the next <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a>. "No, I’ll be the first me, not the next Tom Cruise. Thank you very much," said the actress in an agitated tone.</p><p>It led to fans wondering whether the actress did her own MCU stunts or not. It's no secret that she had two stunt doubles, Joanna Bennett and Renae Moneymaker. Larson even took them on stage when she won the 2019 MTV Movie & TV Award for best fight. So was Larson lying? And where are her stunt doubles now? Here's the whole dish.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Bizarre Reason Fans Are Absolutely Obsessed With Brie Larson's Feet</a></span></p><h2 id=brie-larson-did-most-of-her-stunts>Brie Larson Did Most Of Her Stunts</h2><p>"I just assumed everybody did their own stunts, but it turns out they don’t," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Larson told USA Today</a> of doing her stunts for Captain Marvel. "It was happy ignorance, I guess." The actress then revealed that she was faced with the much challenging reality — working out twice a day for several weeks. "It would be a half-hour in the morning of stretching and stuff on my own," she said of her routine. "Then I’d go with my trainer for an hour and a half. Then I’d go home, shove a bunch of food in my face, take a shower, take a nap under infrared light, wake up an hour later, put on another set of exercise clothes, and then go to the stunt gym and work with the stunt team."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The movie's producer, Jonathan Schwartz confirmed that the Room actress did most of her stunts. "On any other Marvel movie, stunt doubles would be doing 99 percent of what she's doing," he said. "We sort of had to say, 'You need to get some rest. Stop pushing yourself so hard.' When you see this movie, the amount of practical stunts that she’s doing by herself will boggle your mind, and make you say, 'I can’t believe they let her do that.'" He also referred to Larson as the next Tom Cruise.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Brie Larson + 8 Other Oscar-Nominated Stars Who Worked For ​The Disney Channel</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-brie-larson-39-s-stunt-doubles>What Happened To Brie Larson's Stunt Doubles?</h2><p>"I wanted to take this moment to really say thank you to the two women that are standing here beside me," Larson said of Bennett and Moneymaker during her 2019 MTV Award acceptance speech. "These are the women who trained me and were also the stunt doubles for Captain Marvel. I could not have made this film without them. They are really the baseline for who she is. They are the living embodiment of Captain Marvel." It was one of those truly empowering female moments — a much-deserved recognition for the stuntwomen who've both been the muscles behind many other female superhero characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For instance, Bennett alone continues to work as a stunt double for MCU and <a href=#>DC</a>. She did the stunts of Emily VanCamp in Captain America: Civil War, Adrianne Palicki in the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, and Bridget Regan in Agent Carter. She was also the stuntwoman for Gal Gadot in Wonder Woman, Justice League, and Zack Snyder's Justice League; Robin Wright and Doutzen Kroes in Justice League; and Amber Heard and Nicole Kidman in Aquaman.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How The Cast Of 'X-Men' Really Felt About Disgraced Director Bryan Singer</a></span></p><p>Moneymaker has also done stunts for Evangeline Lilly and Michelle Pfeiffer in the Ant-Man movies, Chloe Bennet in the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Rila Fukushima and Tao Okamoto in The Wolverine, Jennifer Lawrence in X-Men: Apocalypse and Days of Future Past, and Margot Robbie in the Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn). Her sister, Heidi Moneymaker is also a stuntwoman married to another fight choreographer and stunt performer, Chad Stahelski. He's done stunts for <a href=#>Keanu Reeves</a> in Constantine. He also co-directed John Wick and is the second-unit director for Captain America: Civil War.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What a cool family, right?</p><p>Larson's stunt doubles are obviously two of the most sought-after female stunt performers in the industry. It's like they never miss a blockbuster each year. It wouldn't be a surprise if one day, they get their own movie or show. A reality show where we get to see their lifestyle, stunt prep, and work on set would certainly be a hit. Imagine getting a cameo of one of the A-list actresses they do stunts for...</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>'Eternals' Director Chloé Zhao's Explains Why She Wanted Harry Styles In The Film</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq7RopxmpJGnwLC60mZpZqukqru1ecOorJuklah6p7vRZpqaqKSWtq95zJqpr52cZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pen-medina-net-worth-3.html><span>←</span><span>Pen Medina Net Worth</span></a>
