So, what really happened to the 12-year-old musical prodigy after his debut appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Ellen DeGeneres Once Banned Sherri Shepherd From Her Show</a></span></p><h2 id=greyson-chance-signed-with-ellen-degeneres-rsquo-recording-label><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Greyson Chance Signed With Ellen DeGeneres’ Recording Label</span></h2><p>Greyson Chance’s debut appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show ended with Ellen gifting him $10,000 and a new piano. The 64-year-old talk show host also signed Chance to her record label, Eleveneleven, granting him a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to realize his dreams of stardom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We just couldn’t believe what was happening,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chance disclosed in a recent interview</a> with RollingStone. “We were so unsure of what we were getting into, and the person that helped cure all of that skepticism and chaotic energy was Ellen.”</p><h2 id=greyson-chance-released-his-debut-album-shortly-after-appearing-on-ellen><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Greyson Chance Released His Debut Album Shortly After Appearing On Ellen</span></h2><p>After signing with her record label, Ellen equipped Greyson Chance with high-profile managers, a publicist, and a brand agent. The 64-year-old comedian also helped Chance secure a booking agent deal with WME.</p><p>Under Ellen’s keen tutelage, Chance released a mini EP and was touring in Canada, Paris, London, and across the United States in less than a year.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Believe That This Is The Interview That Started Ellen's Downfall</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=greyson-chance-had-a-terrible-experience-working-with-ellen><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Greyson Chance Had A Terrible Experience Working With Ellen</span></h2><p>Despite believing in his talent enough to sign him to her record label, Ellen was allegedly anything but kind to Greyson Chance. In his interview with RollingStone, Chance claimed that he had “never met someone more manipulative, more self-centered, and more blatantly opportunistic than [Ellen].”</p><p>“She would come in and look at a rack, yell at stylists, berate people in front of me,” he revealed. “She was just degrading to people.”</p><h2 id=greyson-chance-rsquo-s-debut-album-underperformed><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Greyson Chance’s Debut Album Underperformed</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After a particularly impressive two-year run, Greyson Chance’s career hit the rocks in 2012. Despite Ellen's domineering influence, the tween’s debut album, Truth Be Told: Part One, performed below expectations.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a US Weekly source</a>, Ellen’s menacing mentorship style had nothing to do with this development. “Ellen and the team went above and beyond and sometimes careers just don’t take off.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Of The Most Awkward Interviews From 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a></span></p><h2 id=greyson-chance-felt-completely-abandoned-by-ellen><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Greyson Chance Felt Completely Abandoned By Ellen</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following Truth Be Told: Part One’s dismal performance, Chance was dropped from Ellen’s recording label and his team disbanded. Although Chance continued to appear on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in the years that followed, the once domineering Ellen seemingly lost all interest in him.</p><p>“I couldn’t get ahold of her. Couldn’t talk to her,” Chance revealed to RollingStone. “Whenever I would come on the show, it was such a fake smile. She wouldn’t even ask, ‘How are you doing? How are you holding up?’ It was just like, ‘Here’s what we’re going to talk about. We’ll see you on there.’”</p><h2 id=greyson-chance-briefly-retired-from-music><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Greyson Chance Briefly Retired From Music</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After his time at Eleveneleven came to an unprecedented end, Greyson Chance decided to return to Oklahoma, where he continued to work on his music. However, after releasing the EP Somewhere Over My Head in 2016, Chance decided to retire from music and pursue a college education.</p><p>In his interview with RollingStone, Chance confessed, “[Retiring from music] was me going, ‘You could have had an amazing artist on your hands, but f*ck this. I’m not going to do this anymore. I’m quitting.’“</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Is Ellen DeGeneres Giving Her Staff Members In Bonuses For Her Finale?</a></span></p><h2 id=greyson-chance-revived-his-music-career-after-joining-college><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Greyson Chance Revived His Music Career After Joining College</span></h2><p>Despite his decision to retire, Greyson Chance’s love for music persisted. The 25-year-old ultimately found himself unable to resist making music once again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It was only through that retirement process where I realized that it’s not on them anymore,” he told RollingStone. “‘This is on you.

The 25-year-old recently released his third album, Palladium, which he claims is centered on “protecting your instinct, your heart, [and] your soul.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chance reflected on these post-Ellen successes in his interview with RollingStone. “As much as I would like to say that I could’ve made this album without my past, I just don’t think that’s true," he said. "I just need to be more honest with myself moving forward because I think that’s how I become better from all of this.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brPRnrCsp55isKmtzZycZpmWqbKzeceeZJqooJqus7HDZqanZZWhuaa6jJ2coJ2emr%2Bmv4ysn6ivXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-mr-wonderful-story-how-kevin-oleary-built-his-400-million-empire.html><span>←</span><span>The 'Mr. Wonderful' Story: How Kevin O'Leary Built His 400 Million Empire</span></a>
