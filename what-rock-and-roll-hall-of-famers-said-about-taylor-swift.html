Her talent has done nothing but blossom through her career, and coupled with all the life experience she has gained over the years, she has evolved as a singer and as a songwriter in the best possible way. Maybe that's why her music can be appreciated across all generations and genres.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Just Some Amazing Things Taylor Swift Has Done For The World</a></span>Many Rock & Roll Hall of Famers who have paved the way for modern musicians are continuously blown away by her, and have spoken kind words about her both as a person and as an artist. Let's read what they had to say.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paul-mccartney-appreciates-her-work-ethic><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Paul McCartney Appreciates Her Work Ethic</span></h2><p><a href=#>Taylor Swift's friendly relationship with the McCartney family</a> is nothing new. She did the Rolling Stone issue Musicians on Musicians with the Beatle, who is a two-time Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee, and has worked with his daughters in the past (<a href=#>Stella McCartney designed the clothes for the Evermore and Folklore covers</a>). So, undoubtedly, Paul and his family are fond of the singer, but it's not only her lovely personality that he appreciates. He also likes her music (the pair played Taylor's hit Shake It Off together in 2015) and values her work ethic. In late 2020, both Taylor and Paul had albums coming out, but when Taylor saw that the dates overlapped, she kindly stepped aside.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I did the Rolling Stone cover with Taylor Swift, and she just emailed me recently, and she said, 'I wasn’t telling anyone, but I’ve got another album'. And she said, 'So I was going to put it out on my birthday'," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul said</a>. "And then she said, 'But I found out you were going to put [yours] out on the 10th. So I moved it to the 18th.' And then she found out we were coming out on the 18th so she moved back to the 10th. So I mean, you know, people do keep out of each other’s way. It’s a nice thing to do."</p><h2 id=carole-king-praised-taylor-s-talent-and-influence-on-the-music-industry><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Carole King Praised Taylor's Talent And Influence On The Music Industry</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This year, Carole King was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame for the second time, and Taylor had the honor of inducting her. She gave a beautiful speech and serenaded her with a rendition of "Will You Love Me Tomorrow", moving her to tears. After Carole took the stage, she made sure to return the favor and show her appreciation.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Paul McCartney Has Said About His New Book, 'The Lyrics'</a></span></p><p>"I want to thank Taylor — thank you for that awesome performance. And also, thank you for carrying the torch forward," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>. It wasn't the first time Carole had praised her, though. When she presented Taylor with the Artist of the Decade award at the 2019 American Music Awards, she described her as "extraordinary" for her talent and her impact on music.</p><h2 id=she-saved-dave-grohl-from-embarrassment><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Saved Dave Grohl From Embarrassment</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Dave Grohl</a> was inducted into the R&R Hall of Fame twice, once as part of Nirvana, and recently with the Foo Fighters. Having been in the music industry for so long, Dave shared many moments with Taylor, but the one he remembers the most was when she saved him from embarrassing himself at a party. The two of them, along with other musicians and family, were at <a href=#>his good friend Paul McCartney</a>'s house for a party, watching the Beatle play a few songs on his piano. Dave had been at the party for a while, and was "out of sorts", so when Paul finished playing and his daughters turned to him asking him to play a song, he was caught off guard. He panicked and looked around. He doesn't play piano, and all of Paul's guitars are left-handed, so he didn't know what to do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luckily, Taylor Swift went to the rescue. Dave remembers fondly how she stood up and offered to play instead. She walked to the piano and started to sing beautifully, and Dave thought he recognized the song, so he turned to his wife, who confirmed that she was playing a Foo Fighters song. They all had a good laugh and, feeling more comfortable, Dave joined her in a duet.</p><h2 id=ringo-starr-is-a-fan><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ringo Starr Is A Fan</span></h2><p>Taylor's music has gotten to the heart of the two living Beatles, so she must be doing something right. It was last year, during the pandemic, when Taylor put out some of her best work yet, that Ringo Starr talked about how much he loves her music and her approach to art.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Ringo Starr Met His Wife Of 40 Years, Barbara Bach</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There’s a lot of good bands out there, but nobody’s doing anything," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ringo said</a>. "A lot of people are on that stepping stone to a bigger career, it’s got to be a downer for them. It’s really tough. <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> is the only one who’s doing well. She likes to play by herself. I love her."</p><h2 id=patti-smith-defended-her-against-tough-critics><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Patti Smith Defended Her Against Tough Critics</span></h2><p>Patti Smith, a 2007 <a href=#>R&R Hall of Fame</a> inductee, known for her music and her fierce activism, will not stand Taylor being mistreated by the press. In 2019, people were being hard on Taylor because they disapproved of the lack of political content on her music, but Patti believed the critics to be unfair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She’s a pop star who’s under tremendous scrutiny all the time, and one can’t imagine what that’s like," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patti stated</a>. "It’s unbelievable to not be able to go anywhere, do anything, have messy hair. And I’m sure that she’s trying to do something good. She’s not trying to do something bad. And if it influences some of her avid fans to open up their thoughts, what does it matter? Are we going to start measuring who’s more authentic than who?"</p><h2 id=bruce-springsteen-admires-her-as-a-songwriter><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Bruce Springsteen Admires Her As A Songwriter</span></h2><p>Bruce Springsteen first got introduced to Taylor Swift's music when his daughter was in college and she and her girlfriends took him to a concert. Right then he knew that, while modern pop music wasn't his favorite genre, she was a force to be reckoned with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"[Taylor’s] audience experiences her songwriting very, very personally, and I think she’s speaking to a large part of them very personally," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he said about her music</a>. "As far as craft, [her songs are] really, really well-built and well-made; they’re very, very sturdy, and the records are too. I admire the modern record-making craft and modern songwriting."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Went From Being A Christmas Tree Exterminator To A $400 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr%2Bwr8pmmKecXae8rbiMoZilpF2ks26ywKacq6tdqK6qsIyamaitpGLBosXLqKlmq6ees7V7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./venus-raj-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-239584-html.html><span>←</span><span>Venus Raj Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
