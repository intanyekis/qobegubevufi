She was dressed in a beautiful Clare Waight Keller wedding gown with a 16-foot veil that featured hand-embroidered flowers from all the Commonwealth countries. And after the ceremony, the late Queen Elizabeth II bestowed upon the married couple the titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex.</p><p>Compared to that, Markle's first wedding was the wildest affair that a bunch of LA residents with ties to Hollywood could come up with.</p><h2 id=meghan-markle-39-s-first-wedding-was-a-four-day-extravaganza-in-jamaica>Meghan Markle's First Wedding Was A Four-Day Extravaganza In Jamaica</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trevor Engelson and Meghan Markle got married in Jamaica</a> in the cruise ship port of Ocho Rios.

There was enough to roll all the joints in the goodie bags and have plenty of leftovers to pass around as and when needed over the weekend.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tyler Perry Had Second Thoughts About Becoming Godfather To Meghan And Harry's Baby</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, when Meghan Markle and Trevor Engelson got married, Jamaica had very strict laws regarding the possession of marijuana. But according to the source, everyone took it very lightly and Meghan did not even know of the law's existence.</p><p>“There was a lot of drinking all weekend,” the source revealed. “There were cocktails like Pinã Colada and Long Island Iced Tea, and of course lots of rum and a lot of Red Stripe [local beer].”</p><p>The source did mention that Meghan was more of a wine and champagne kind of girl and smoking the joints was more Trevor and his friends' thing.</p><h2 id=rowdy-party-games-were-a-staple>Rowdy Party Games Were A Staple</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meghan and her mother had been to Jamaica a few times when she was younger, so the place held special significance for her. Plus, the source revealed, Meghan had 'always wanted to get married with her toes in the sand.'</p><p>“It was an epic weekend under the sun and stars.” There were a lot of party games. Drinking ones especially.</p><p>Some media outlets got their hands on pictures from that weekend. One, in particular, shows Meghan being 'wheel-barrowed' across the sand by a male guest in what appears to be a paired 'wheel-barrow' race.</p><p>“You could tell there was other sorts of things going on,” the source revealed. “Some people got really rowdy, including Trevor’s friends and some of Meghan’s Suits co-stars... There was drinking games on the sand, people passing out, and others being loud.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What's King Charles' Reaction To Prince Harry's Memoir, Spare?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They also had many competitions on the beach, like tug-of-war and beer pong.</p><p>“Most guests were couples, but there was some hooking up between the single people... nothing too crazy and public. And the night of the wedding, the party went until very late.”</p><p>Other pictures obtained by the press revealed the dress Meghan wore for her wedding: a simple white strapless gown that fell all the way to the floor and had a sweet V-cut in the front.</p><p>The dress also had an embellished belt, which is a very common design in simple wedding gowns, but a lot of people speculated that Meghan was somehow copying Kate Middleton's wedding dress with that choice.</p><p>Pictures of the latter's wedding gown reveal that Kate Middleton's gown and Meghan Markle's first wedding dress have as much in common as a blueberry and the color of the sky.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsSiv4ymnKCgkaN6rq3RpKOeq12btrO%2F02aunpyUnruoecuiop5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mayte-carranco.html><span>←</span><span>Mayte Carranco</span></a>
