The portal&nbsp;also entertained the possibility that the name was one of her ex-lovers'. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On May 22, 2015, the actress’s unicorn tattoo made into the news yet again when she&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">posted</a> a picture of it on Facebook and hinted that she was about to have it removed. In the captions, she assured fans that the only tattoos that she'd be removing were the ones that were not done well in the first place.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Her famous unicorn tattoo being the face of such a comment suggested that she was not fond of that particular piece anymore. She also thanked LaserAway, the skincare experts that helped her erase the ink.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, in the last <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">picture</a> from the series of snaps she posted on Instagram on&nbsp;January 10, 2019, Rose&nbsp;can be seen with her leg&nbsp;tattoo, indicating&nbsp;her decision to opt-out of the removal process midway. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Deciding To 'Break Free'</h2><p><span>On July 15, 2014, Rose </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>released</span></a><span> a short movie </span><span>Break Free&nbsp;</span><span>based on the experiences of gender-fluid people, much like herself. Her short went on to amass&nbsp;five million YouTube views and&nbsp; 200,000 Facebook fans within a fortnight of its release.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In conversation with&nbsp;The&nbsp;Guardian, the actress <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">confirmed</a>&nbsp;it&nbsp;to be&nbsp;autobiographical. She further&nbsp;elaborated&nbsp;how as a kid, she used to think of herself as a boy. The actress also confessed to&nbsp;binding her breasts with ACE bandages and sleeping on her chest to stop the growth of her breasts.&nbsp;</p><p>In her teens, her mom pressured her into being more "feminine," right up until the actress decided that she'd had enough. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Subsequently,&nbsp;she shaved&nbsp;her head, deciding to&nbsp;be whoever she wanted to be.&nbsp;</p><p><span>The actress revealed that it&nbsp;led her to be&nbsp;bullied&nbsp;and was even physically assaulted&nbsp;by guys a few times, so much so that&nbsp;she was compelled to grow her hair and act more feminine unwillingly. Nonetheless, after joining </span><span>MTV</span><span>, the actress chopped off her hair once and for all, and the rest, as they say, is history.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Her Latest Project</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>On March 13, 2021, Rose took to her Instagram to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">announce</a>&nbsp;her new movie SAS Red Notice&nbsp;in Great Britain.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>SAS Red Notice&nbsp;is an action-thriller <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">based </a>on the best-selling novel written by veteran SAS operator Andy McNab.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Talking&nbsp;with Collider, the star <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">affirmed</a>&nbsp;it to be a fun movie, with a script that "deals with things that are probably relatable with governments across the globe."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGijoJqknr5ww8eepWaqpZfGbr7OrJxmrJikwqi002aYm6elqXqosdOtoKefXae2pXnOn2ShnaJiwam1xqFkrZmkqbywecGuq2abmJa7qLHDZp%2Beql2itq%2BwjKWYrZ2iY7W1ucs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./manolo-favis-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Manolo Favis Net Worth</span></a>
