He always has the goofiest lines and people know it will be a funny movie when his name is on the cast list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But in the movie industry, actors do sometimes leave films that they might have been with for years and other people replace them. When this happens, people tend to be both wary and excited about how things will turn out.</p><p>In this instance, Adam Sandler leaving the Hotel Transylvania franchise was met with a lot more wariness because a lot of people didn’t think anyone could reprise his role in the movies. Yet the change seemed to go better than expected when it came to the film's release in January of 2022.</p><h2 id=what-is-hotel-transylvania-transformania-about>What Is Hotel Transylvania: Transformania About?</h2><p>Hotel Transylvania: Transformania is the fourth and final installment of the Hotel Transylvania movie franchise.</p><p>The animated movie follows Dracula (who up to now has been voiced by Adam Sandler) and his family as they are transformed into humans by Van Helsing's new invention, while the human son-in-law Johnny is turned into a monster.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The family has to navigate the human world and race the clock to turn back into their original forms before it is too late. While Adam Sandler won't be returning to the franchise for the latest installment, Selena Gomez is making her return as Mavis, alongside Andy Samberg as Mavis' husband Johnny.</p><p>Other returning actors include Jim Gaffigan as Van Helsing, Steve Buscemi as Wayne, and Kathryn Hahn as Ericka Van Helsing.</p><p>These are just some of the many cast members who worked hard to put this film together. Yet while they did work hard, reviews for the film have been a bit underwhelming. Many viewers seem to think the fourth installment is just like the other movies, with differences that seem to be dependent only on cast and director changes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Has Selena Gomez's Career Finally Peaked?">Has Selena Gomez's Career Finally Peaked?</a></span></p><p>But outside those changes, reviews seem to be on the more positive side since it is a children's movie that is meant to be goofy and uplifting.</p><p>The great news is that even without Adam Sandler in it, people still say it is a funny movie and great for the family to watch together.</p><h2 id=why-adam-sandler-isn-rsquo-t-in-hotel-transylvania>Why Adam Sandler Isn’t In Hotel Transylvania</h2><p><a href=#>There is a lot of speculation as to why Adam Sandler is not in the movie</a>, and neither Sandler nor Sony have released official explanations for his leaving.</p><p>But while there are not any confirmed reasons for him leaving the franchise, it is believed to be largely in part of his new development deal with Netflix. <a href=#>It has been said that Sandler’s newest contract includes four new films</a>, worth a whopping $250 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adam Sandler was also one of the executive producers for the Hotel Transylvania franchise but left after the third film. Rumors suggest that he might have been taken out of the franchise because he was working on a rival animation for Netflix.</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=# title="Does Adam Sandler Overpay To Have His Friends In His Films?">Does Adam Sandler Overpay To Have His Friends In His Films?</a></span></p><p>It's true that <a href=#>Adam has an ongoing relationship with Netflix</a>, but nothing has been confirmed in terms of a rivalry. Luckily for fans of the hilarious Count Dracula, they found an excellent replacement to him that will have even the best listeners struggling to tell the difference in the movies.</p><h2 id=who-replaced-adam-sandler-in-hotel-transylvania-4>Who Replaced Adam Sandler In Hotel Transylvania 4?</h2><p>Now for the big reveal: the person who ended up replacing Adam Sandler as Dracula was… Brian Hull! He was an excellent choice for the role because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hull already had experience playing Dracula</a> in Monster Pets, which was a Hotel Transylvania short film focusing on the residents of the Hotel Transylvania and their unique pets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He is also an impressionist with a massive YouTube following known for his wide range of animated character impressions, including Mickey, Shaggy, and Mater.</p><p>Hull was also brought in at a good time, according to the director. The director has stated that since Dracula was turned into a human in this movie, the difference in his voice would not be as noticeable as it was in other movies because they wanted Dracula to look and act a little differently than in previous movies.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Adam Sandler Thinks This Character He Played Is The Most Like His Real Personality</a></span></p><p>So unless the viewer is very sharp-eared, there should not have been much of a difference in the movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-else-didn-rsquo-t-return-for-hotel-transylvania-4>Who Else Didn’t Return For Hotel Transylvania 4?</h2><p>For viewers that were listening closely, some might have noticed that Frankenstein also sounded a little different in this movie compared to others. Kevin James also did not return to the franchise and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Frankenstein was voiced by Brad Abrell</a>.</p><p>Abrell has been a voice actor for several other films and shows, including Chicken Little, Spongebob Squarepants, and Men in Black, both the movies and animated series.</p><p>James also never released an official explanation for why he left the franchise, but it is rumored that he also left because of a new development deal with Netflix. There are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">movies in the works with Kevin James and Netflix</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While there are different voice actors for these well-known characters, the films are still great for a family movie night in or just to rewatch as fun favorites. Fans of the movie have nothing to worry about because every actor did a job well done. So sit back and enjoy the show!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>What Has Adam Sandler Been Up To In 2021?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddp7KxuMCcnJ1lkZmurnnSmqWdpJWneqm7056jZqyilru0xcuvmKehkWLBs63NrJ2oqp2Wu6qtjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cory-binney.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Cory Binney dating?
