He's done loads of film and television work, and he even had a stint in a popular <a href=#>DC</a> franchise <a href=#>before his brother departed for good</a>.</p><p>So, who was Robbie Amell before playing Nathan on Upload? Let's take a closer look at the talented actor's history in the entertainment industry.</p><h2 id=robbie-amell-currently-stars-on-39-upload-39>Robbie Amell Currently Stars On 'Upload'</h2><p>Right now, things are looking awfully great for actor Robbie Amell. Upload just wrapped up its second season, and the show has been making waves with fans during its run on Amazon Prime.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Upload made its debut two years back, and people fell in love with what the first season had to offer. Robbie Amell was a perfect pick for the lead character on the show, and he had exceptional chemistry with the rest of the cast.</p><p>Thankfully, the first season was a hit, and a second season was announced. Unfortunately, it would be quite some time before the second season was unleashed.</p><p>Amell talked with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a>, and he was asked about getting back into character after a long break.</p><p>"No, I think Nathan is probably the most of myself that I bring to any project I’ve shot. Just from day one, reading the pilot, we have the same mannerisms, same sense of humor, same speech and cadence. It just felt like Greg [Daniels] wrote him for me, which I know he didn’t. It just felt very, very at home for me. I loved shooting the first season so much, I only grew more into that. Greg’s really great at finding his actors’ voices and bringing them to the characters. It was such a great cliffhanger that it was tough to forget where I left off," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the long wait, the show managed to deliver the goods for season two, and once again, people are waiting for a fresh season of Upload to enter the fold.</p><p>Amell has been brilliant on the show, but he had a long road to get to where he is now.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Was Courteney Cox's Favorite Guest-Star Love Interest On 'Friends'?</a></span></p><h2 id=amell-was-on-shows-like-39-the-flash-39>Amell Was On Shows Like 'The Flash'</h2><p>Long before he was cast as the lead character and Upload, Robbie Amell was leaving a mark on television with performances on other shows.</p><p>Amell has been featured on notable shows like Life with Derek, True Jackson, How I Met Your Mother, Revenge, CSI: NY, Pretty Little Liars, Hawaii Five-0, and a whole lot more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2014, he had the opportunity to join his brother, Stephen, in the Arrowverse. Amell played the character Firestorm on The Flash, and he was part of that show for a total of 13 episodes.</p><p>When <a href=#>talking about the character</a>, Amell said, "Ronnie works with all of these scientists, but he’s the hands-on guy. He’s the mechanic among the group of engineers. He’s got this way about him where he can bring people out of their shell. If you watch the dynamic between he and Caitlin, compared to Caitlin and everyone else, she’s a little neurotic and by-the-books and everything is calculated, but Ronnie can pull her out of that and just let her drop her guard a little. I wanted that to be a staple of this character."</p><p>Amell was great as the character, but he has really taken things to another level on Upload as Nathan.</p><p>His TV work is great, but Amell has done solid work in film, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Was Jack Quaid Before 'The Boys'?</a></span></p><h2 id=robbie-amell-also-appeared-in-notable-films>Robbie Amell Also Appeared In Notable Films</h2><p>On the big screen, fans have gotten to enjoy Robbie Amell taking part in projects dating back to the 2000s.</p><p>Amell has been in movies like Cheaper by the Dozen 2, Left for Dead, The DUFF, Code 8, and The Babysitter.</p><p>Amell was able to stand out while starring in The DUFF alongside Mae Whitman, and the duo had great chemistry in the film. It was a moderate success at the box office, proving that Amell can excel on the big or small screen.</p><p>Just last year, the actor starred in Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City, and fans were really excited to see what he was going to bring to the movie. It wasn't a major hit, but it was great seeing him in a franchise film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Was Ella Purnell Before 'Yellowjackets'?</a></span></p><p>Amell is true talent, and fans are hopeful for a third season of Upload.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Was Nina Dobrev Before 'The Vampire Diaries'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60edGomZuhlWKurrHLpWSbnZakv6Z51KmjqJmUZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lily-afshar-classical-guitarist-died-at-63.html><span>←</span><span>Lily Afshar Classical Guitarist died at 63 : How did She die?</span></a>
