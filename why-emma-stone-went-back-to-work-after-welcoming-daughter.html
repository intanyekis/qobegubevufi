That’s just not her,” a source exclusively shares in the new issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now. “Acting is as vital to her as breathing, it’s a part of who she is — and Dave’s 100 percent behind her.”</p><p>Stone, 34, and McCary, 38, met in December 2016 during her stint as a host on <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>. (The Easy A actress starred in a sketch that the comedian wrote). They <a href=#>got engaged</a> three years later and secretly <a href=#>tied the knot</a> in 2020.</p><p>Later that year, Stone<a href=#> opened up to Entertainment Tonight </a>about creating a family with McCary. “I feel pretty good about starting my own pack. Although I don’t think that my pack would be quite as physically capable as the Croods are,” she said, referring to her animated movie Croods. “They’re pretty rough and tumble and I don’t know if my pack would be as rough and tumble.”</p><p>After Stone gave birth months later, <a href=#>an insider told Us exclusively</a> that having a baby “brought them closer in a way they never expected.” The insider added that McCary was very “hands-on and helping with their daughter.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Now that Stone’s gone back to work, “she and Dave are happy as a couple and one of the reasons why is they respect each other as artists,” the source tells Us, noting that while being a working mom does have its challenges, Stone has got “a great set-up.”</p><p>“She’s able to bring Louise to the set with her and that makes a huge difference,” the source continues. Plus, “there is no shortage of people in her circle willing to help with Louise — and Emma is grateful to them.”</p><p>Most importantly, she’s got McCary. “They love their little family. Louise has brought them so much joy and they’re growing and learning every day,” shares the source. “They’re in this together. Emma still has the Hollywood ambition and drive and determination to do her best work and it keeps her going, and she believes doing what she loves will also make her a better mom.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGawoKlisq65wGaqraeemnq4sc2tZJuZk6B6tbuMsKaro12Ws7Wx0WaunqSTpLqqusZmm5qtl53Bpr6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-george-sydnor-jr-suspect-in-washington-hotel-homicide-had-lengthy-criminal-record-612978-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who is George Sydnor Jr.?
